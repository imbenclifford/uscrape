Thanks for\nparticipating and please remember to check back for comments on your\nnomination (consider watchlisting your nomination page).\n\n_**If this is your first nomination, please read the DYK rules before\ncontinuing:**_ _Official DYK criteria:_ **DYK rules** and supplementary\nguidelines _Unofficial guide:_ Learning DYK\n\n### To nominate an article[edit]\n\nRead these instructions completely before proceeding.\n\n_For simplified instructions, see User:Rjanag/Quick DYK 2._\n\n**I**. | \n\nCreate the nomination subpage.\n\nEnter the article title in the box below and click the button. (To nominate\nmultiple articles together, enter any or all of the article titles.) You will\nthen be taken to a preloaded nomination page.\n\n  \n  \n  \n---|---  \n**II**. | \n\nWrite the nomination.\n\nOn the nomination page, fill in the relevant information. See\nTemplate:NewDYKnomination and `{{NewDYKnomination/guide}}` for further\ninformation.\n\n  * Not every line of the template needs to be filled in. For instance, if you are not nominating an image to appear with your hook, there is no need to fill in the image-related lines.\n  * Add an edit summary e,g, \"Nominating YOUR ARTICLE TITLE for DYK\" and click _Save page_.\n  * Make sure the nomination page is on your watchlist, so you can follow the review discussion.  \n**III**. | \n\nPost at **Template talk:Did you know**.\n\nIn the current nominations section find the subsection for the **date on which\nthe article was created or on which expansion began**, not the date on which\nyou make the nomination.\n\n  * At the _top_ of that subsection (before other nominations already there, but below the section head and hidden comment) add `{{Did you know nominations/YOUR ARTICLE TITLE}}`.\n  * Add an edit summary e.g. \"Nominating YOUR ARTICLE TITLE for DYK\" and click _Save page_.\n  * Consider adding `{{Did you know nominations/YOUR ARTICLE TITLE}}` to the article's talk page (_without_ a section heading\u2014\u200b\u200bthe template adds a section heading automatically).  \n  \n### How to review a nomination[edit]\n\nMain page: Wikipedia:Did you know/Reviewing guide\n\nAny editor who was not involved in writing/expanding or nominating an article\nmay review it by checking to see that the article meets all the DYK criteria\n(long enough, new enough, no serious editorial or content issues) and the hook\nis cited. Editors may also alter the suggested hook to improve it, suggest new\nhooks, or even lend a hand and make edits to the article to which the hook\napplies so that the hook is supported and accurate. For a more detailed\ndiscussion of the DYK rules and review process see the supplementary\nguidelines and the WP:Did you know/Reviewing guide.\n\nTo post a comment or review on a DYK nomination, follow the steps outlined\nbelow:\n\n  * Look through this page, **Template talk:Did you know**, to find a nomination you would like to comment on.\n  * Click the \"Review or comment\" link at the top of the nomination. You will be taken to the nomination subpage.\n  * The top of the page includes a list of the DYK criteria. Check the article to ensure it meets all the relevant criteria.\n  * To indicate the result of the review (i.e., whether the nomination passes, fails, or needs some minor changes), leave a signed comment on the page. Please begin with one of the 5 review symbols that appear at the top of the edit screen, and then indicate all aspects of the article that you have reviewed; your comment should look something like the following: \n\n> `Article length and age are fine, no copyvio or plagiarism concerns,\nreliable sources are used. But the hook needs to be shortened.`\n\nIf you are the first person to comment on the nomination, there will be a line\n`:* <!-- REPLACE THIS LINE TO WRITE FIRST COMMENT, KEEPING :* -->` showing you\nwhere you should put the comment.\n\n  * Save the page.\n\nIf there is any problem or concern about a nomination, please consider\nnotifying the nominator by placing\n**{{subst:DYKproblem|Article|header=yes|sig=yes}}** on the nominator's talk\npage.\n\n### Frequently asked questions[edit]\n\n#### Backlogged?[edit]\n\nThis page is often backlogged. As long as your submission is still on the\npage, it will stay there until an editor reviews it. Since editors are\nencouraged to review the oldest submissions first (so that those hooks don't\ngrow stale), it may take several weeks until your submission is reviewed. In\nthe meantime, please consider reviewing another submission (not your own) to\nhelp reduce the backlog (see instructions above).\n\n#### Where is my hook?[edit]\n\nIf you can't find the hook you submitted to this page, in most cases it means\nyour article has been approved and is in the queue for display on the main\npage. You can check whether your hook has been moved to the queue by reviewing\nthe **queue listings**.\n\nIf your hook is not in the queue or already on the main page, it has probably\nbeen deleted. Deletion occurs if the hook is more than about eight days old\nand has unresolved issues for which any discussion has gone stale. If you\nthink your hook has been unfairly deleted, you can query its deletion on the\ndiscussion page, but as a general rule deleted hooks will only be restored in\nexceptional circumstances.\n\n### Search archived DYK nomination discussions[edit]\n\n  \n\n## Instructions for other editors[edit]\n\n### How to promote an accepted hook[edit]\n\n  * See Wikipedia:Did you know/Preparation areas for full instructions.\n  * In one window, open the DYK nomination subpage of the hook you would like to promote. In another window, open the **prep set** you intend to add the hook to.\n  * In the prep set...\n\n    \n\n  * Paste the hook into the hook area\n  * Paste the credit information ({{DYKmake}} and/or {{DYKnom}}) into the credits area.\n\n  * Back on DYK nomination page...\n\n    \n\n  * change `{{DYKsubpage` to `{{**subst:**DYKsubpage`\n  * change `|passed=` to `|passed=yes`\n  * Add an edit summary e.g. \"Promoted to Prep 3\", and save.\n\n### How to remove a rejected hook[edit]\n\n  * Open the DYK nomination subpage of the hook you would like to remove. (It's best to wait several days after a reviewer has rejected the hook, just in case someone contests or the article undergoes a large change.)\n  * In the window where the DYK nomination subpage is open, replace the line `{{DYKsubpage` with `{{**subst:**DYKsubpage`, and replace `|passed=` with `|passed=no`. Then save the page. This has the effect of wrapping up the discussion on the DYK nomination subpage in a blue archive box and stating that the nomination was unsuccessful, as well as adding the nomination to a category for archival purposes.\n\n### How to remove a hook from the prep areas or queue[edit]\n\n  * Edit the prep area or queue where the hook is and remove the hook and the credits associated with it.\n  * Go to the hook's nomination subpage (there is usually a link to it in the credits section). \n    * View the edit history for that page\n    * Go back to the last version _before_ the edit where the hook was promoted, and revert to that version to make the nomination active again.\n    * Leave a comment explaining that the hook was removed from the queue, and why, so that later reviewers are aware of this issue.\n    * If the day title for the section that contained the hook has been removed from this page, restore that section.\n  * If you removed the hook from a queue, it is best to either replace it with another hook from one of the prep areas, or to leave a message at WT:DYK asking someone else to do so.\n  * Add a link to the nomination subpage at Wikipedia:Did you know/Removed\n\n### How to move a nomination subpage to a new name[edit]\n\n  * Don't; it should not ever be necessary, and will break some links which will later need to be repaired. Even if you change the title of the article, you don't need to move the nomination page.\n\n# Nominations[edit]\n\n## Older nominations[edit]\n\n### Articles created/expanded on February 2[edit]\n\n#### Sintax the Terrific\n\n  * ( Review or comment\n  * Article history )\n\n  * ... that the rapper **Sintax the Terrific** is also a practicing licensed federal attorney?\n\n    \n\n  *   * _Comment_: ~~QPQ review pending~~ _Reviewed_: State Shinto\n\nCreated by The Cross Bearer (talk).

You added AllMusic links that talk (very briefly) about deepspace5, and not Syntax in particular. If that displays notability, it's inherited notability and thus does not count. You also added a text from a source called \"Sphere of Hip-Hop\" which does not seem to be a notable source. The same thing applies for \"Rapreviews.com.\" I really do want this article (and its DYK) to survive, but I can't do that on the basis of these sources.**\u2014\u2666\u2666 _AMBER_(\u042f\u0298CK)** 22:57, 3 March 2016 (UTC)\n    I do know that notability is not inherited through the Deepspace5 mentions, that was just part of the expansion. I included more citations to the _Houston Chronicle_, Cross Rhythms, and CMWeb, independent sources that were already in the article. RapReviews.com is a professional review site, and is even used by the aggregator Metacritic. It is included on the list of reliable music sources found through WikiProject Albums. Sphere of Hip Hop is also a professional review source, though admittedly not as high profile as RapReviews.com. It is included on the List of reliable sources found through the Christian music project. I don't see how with significant discussions in five independent reliable sources, plus the Rap Up feature (an interview in an independent reliable source), the subject is not notable.--**3family6** (_Talk to me_ | See what I have done) 23:22, 3 March 2016 (UTC) \n\n  * ![Symbol redirect vote 4.svg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Symbol_redirect_vote_4.svg/16px-Symbol_redirect_vote_4.svg.png) I'll let someone else take the reins here, then.

In its current state, I do not find it overly interesting, but maybe that's just my opinion. The hook could do with a cleanup. For example, it links to a redirect of the article in bold, so maybe delink it and place it in italics to stress the name. Also, the tick should really be AGF, because there is not a single external link in the article and I'm struggling to find anything noting its existence through Google.

None of the sources are online, and a search on \"Phou Khao Kham\" shows only WP clones and two of the (offline) books, but I am willing to assume good faith given the author's edit history. Aymatth2 (talk) 14:53, 19 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n  * ![Symbol question.svg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e0/Symbol_question.svg/16px-Symbol_question.svg.png) My understanding of reading the article is that Gold Mountain is a codename. The article doesn't go on to explain the origins of this name, so I'm not sure one can assume that this is a real placename. However, my understanding of reading the hook is that Gold Mountain is a mountain and that troops were refitted inside of it (like a mine shaft or tunnel etc). There's some obvious ambiguity between the article and hook that needs to be resolved. Either a new hook or explanatory text behind \"Gold Mountain\". **Jolly \u03a9 Janner** 20:15, 19 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n    \n\n    \n\n  * I have revisited the article. Where I once had an ambiguous \"it\", I substituted \"the operation\". I make no mention of a mine or tunnel in the article. On checking the source, I find, \"Regrouping for three days, the task force was given a new operational name\u2014Phou Khao Kham (Golden Mountain)...\" It was customary to take advantage of the air bridge during this war to resupply units in the field. However, because that is not specifically stated by the quote above, I have slightly altered the hook.\n  * Now, as to ambiguity in the ALT1 hook. Would you not be curious about whether those troops actually did enter a tunnel? And then, click to find out? According to the Reviewer's guide, a hook can be, \"A tease, giving only part of the relevant information.\" As I have done.\n  * And there is no use having an article on the Laotian Civil War if you are not going to use it, so I linked it into ALT2. And again, the tease to draw readers into WP.\n  * I realize this review has probably turned problematic and frustrating for you. I do appreciate your patience in this matter.Georgejdorner (talk) 20:58, 19 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n    \n\n  * I understand why you have used a \"tease\", but it shouldn't be used to give misinformation (unless there is humour, in which case April Fools applies). It leads people on to believe they were stations in a mountain, yes. But when you read the article, it leaves (me at least) even more confused. **Jolly \u03a9 Janner** 21:31, 19 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n    \n\n  * If you will point out the false information in the hook, I will remove it. However, if there is no false information there, then I believe it becomes apparent that your reaction is an individual misunderstanding.\n  * Now, to clear up some other loose ends. Top Secret information on military operations is bound to be difficult to find on the internet. However, the main source for this article can be viewed at [1].\n  * I do not care whether this runs as April Foolishness, or not.\n  * I have now supplied the means for the reviewers to rewrite the hook and/or the article for themselves. I have also exhausted my store of explanations. From here on out, the reviewer(s) can pass the nom, fail it, rewrite whatever they wish. I am through with this nomination (except for removal of any possible misinfo in the hook). I could be spending my time productively elsewhere.Georgejdorner (talk) 17:05, 20 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n    \n\n  * ![Symbol voting keep.svg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Symbol_voting_keep.svg/16px-Symbol_voting_keep.svg.png) ALT1 and ALT2 are both consistent with the article text. The troops were regrouped in a place the military called Phou Khao Kham (Gold Mountain). There is no implication that they were regrouped inside a mountain and no need to spell out that this was not Gold Mountain, California. The article and hook are fine. Let's move on. Aymatth2 (talk) 22:25, 20 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n    \n\n    \n\n  * Here is the current article's text that covers the hook: \"The stalled offensive force was removed from the ridge where it had encamped, and leapfrogged over the foe to be landed at a vacant Auto Defense Choc site, Xieng Dat. They were refurbished for three days in preparation of a heliborne assault on Muang Soui; in the process, the operation was renamed Phou Khao Kham (meaning Gold Mountain).\" It sounds like they were refitted in _Xieng Dat_. Please be aware that non-military experts do not know that operations are named after locations. **Jolly \u03a9 Janner** 23:19, 20 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n    \n\n  * @Jolly Janner: What hook do you propose? Aymatth2 (talk) 00:12, 21 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n    \n\n  * I wouldn't propose using any of the hooks that have been proposed so far. I also cannot find anything interesting in the article's prose to use either. There could perhaps be something in there, but I'm very unfamiliar with military history, and don't have access to the sources. At this point the best thing to do may be to see if anyone comes up with any hooks and if nothing comes up for a while to just abandon it. **Jolly \u03a9 Janner** 05:03, 21 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n### Articles created/expanded on February 12[edit]\n\n#### Kamal Foroughi\n\n  * ( Review or comment\n  * Article history )\n\n  * ... that the family of **Kamal Foroughi**, a British-Iranian businessman jailed in Tehran's Evin Prison since May 2011, has described him as one of the \"oldest and loneliest prisoners in Iran\"?\n\n    \n\n  * _Reviewed_: Template:Did you know nominations/Bobby White\n\nCreated by Plot Spoiler (talk).

The article is new enough and long enough, but from there I begin having issues. It needs serious copyediting for language reasons; its title does not meet the Manual of Style; it has a serious neutrality problem, which extends to the hook; and stylistically it does not look like an article in this encyclopedia.

Mhhossein (talk) 04:17, 23 February 2016 (UTC)\n\n    \n\n  * Mhhossein, having read the article, I think the NPOV template on it is appropriate. The allegations are unsupported, the sentence that you just restored a clear case of putting words in Ya'alon's mouth\u2014he didn't say (or even clearly threaten) that assassinations would resume\u2014since he's never said that Israel was assassinating scientists, the claim that he said they would resume is a complex question and unworthy of a Wikipedia article. I also don't think much of the IBTimes based on the headline which makes the same inappropriate assumption, and wonder whether they should be deemed a reliable source if they're willing to publish it. Reading the article, the prose is definitely rough, but far more important is that the article is built so that the only conclusion is that Israel has been assassinating Iranian scientists. Three people are cited as backing this conclusion\u2014Burleigh, Rubin, and Hibbs\u2014though their arguments are weak and highly circumstantial. Further, not one skeptic is included, nor any contrary evidence, and I very much doubt these don't exist. I'm afraid that I agree with the comments above; I don't see how this article can be salvaged for the purposes of DYK given the base assumptions that pervade the article. BlueMoonset (talk) 05:01, 23 February 2016 (UTC)\n\n  * @BlueMoonset, Jolly Janner and Raymie. I have done some editing to restore NPOV. Perhaps you can now review and give the poor man his DYK credit?\u00a0:D Please ping me if you think the articles needs more editing. FreeatlastChitchat (talk) 09:06, 23 February 2016 (UTC)\n\n    \n\n  * @FreeatlastChitchat: Article still needs editing, especially the lead. I would rather see this nomination rejected and improvements discussed on the article talk page. **Jolly \u03a9 Janner** 09:24, 23 February 2016 (UTC)\n\n    \n\n    BlueMoonset: Thanks for reading the article. By \"The allegations are unsupported\" did you mean they were not sourced, or you yourself find it unsupported? I read the interview of Ya'alon which was originally published in Der Spiegel and I found nothing about resuming the assassinations, so you could have meant that the analysis by IBT was just an Op-Ed. That's right, but what do you say about similar things published in the independent and The Jersalem Post (read the first three line in both)? Btw, I think we are not here to judge whose conclusion is weak or strong, because simply we have to rely on reliable sources and reflect them from a neutral viewpoint. Instead we'd better say whether they are credible to make such comments or not. Those three persons have their points, certainly. These are while I can accept that the article structure had to change to achieve neutrality and I agree on most of the changes done by FreeatlastChitchat. Neutral articles are much better understood by the readers in my opinion, and and If I had missed a point, this does not mean that I did not wanted them added to the article. Mhhossein (talk) 11:45, 23 February 2016 (UTC)\n    @Mhhossein: I've done some major copyediting for tone and grammar, which has improved the article. My one thing that I think could use improvement in your future articles is that you're overlinking. Once you link to an article like Mossad once, you probably don't need to do it again. However, my concerns about neutrality still remain and I would be hesitant to give it a positive review. Raymie (t \u2022 c) 00:40, 24 February 2016 (UTC) \n\n    Raymie: Thank you very much, the article is even better now. Also, thank you for your practical tip.

However I cannot pass the proposed hooks. The first one claims Israel's involvement to be a fact (which the article says it isn't) and the second one may say \"allegedly\" but still implies it in the same way as the first one. There needs to be some new hooks before we can consider allowing this to run on the main page. **The C of E God Save the Queen!** (talk) 09:27, 13 March 2016 (UTC) \n\n    I agree with that. I was going to mention the hooks, but thought it best to deal with one issue at a time. I will probably suggest an alt hook after working on the article if nobody has come up with a viable alternative by then. Gatoclass (talk) 11:45, 13 March 2016 (UTC) \n\n    The article is looking better. I would propose the following as a potential hook (135 characters, including spaces and punctuation):\n    **ALT2**: ... that several parties are alleged to be separately responsible for an assassination campaign aimed at Iran's top **nuclear scientists**?\n    \\- **tucoxn**\\talk 20:42, 13 March 2016 (UTC) \n\n    I like the new ALT2 hook. I'm giving this a re-read, as it has been some time since I originally examined the article and copyedited it. I think the article has improved substantially and is now likely ready for a DYK after the extensive copyediting and neutrality improvements. About the only thing I did was change out some semicolons for colons. That said, I'd want someone else to agree with me before sending this to a queue.

This article needs a very thorough rewrite before it is fit to be plaved on the main page. It is very confusingly written and in parts impossible to understand. Especially the \"events\" section is very poor, starting with things like \"On 4 January 1978 , this article was put in the pocket sealed by Imperial Court and sent from Amir-Abbas Hoveyda, prime minister of that time to information minister Daryush Homayun to publishing it in the one of the newspaper. In other word, this article was prepared under in section of court minister Hoveyda.\" \"Put in the pocket sealed by\"? \"Under in section of\"? It continues in the same vein, with \"The primary text of article was a pacific word, \", \"Also, the Indian referred to love poem that he wrote when he was young and singed them by this title.\", and so on. The first paragraph of that section seems to suggest the article was approved by the prime minister, while the second paragraph states \"the regime's religious opponents published an article\".

The seeming contradiction is intended in the hook, as I felt this would be puzzling to the reader and they would read the articles to find out.--**3family6** (_Talk to me_ | See what I have done) 14:14, 18 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n### Articles created/expanded on February 23[edit]\n\n#### Huntsham Court\n\n  * ( Review or comment\n  * Article history )\n\n![Western facade of Huntsham Court](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/\n0/01/Huntsham_Court%2C_Devon.jpg/120px-Huntsham_Court%2C_Devon.jpg)\n\nWestern facade of Huntsham Court\n\n  * ... that during his stay at **Huntsham Court** _(pictured)_, Douglas Adams failed to make progress in writing _So Long, and Thanks for all the Fish_, but enjoyed \"sipping expensive wines\"?\n\n    \n\n  * **ALT1**:... that a private act of parliament was passed in 1866 to allow for the construction of the current **Huntsham Court** _(pictured)_ over the previous dilapidated Elizabethan mansion?\n  * _Reviewed_: Principality of Erfurt\n  * _Comment_: Could be used for 11 March (Douglas Adams Birthday)?\n\nCreated by Boddah (talk).

But, in any case, DYK is explicitly open to incomplete work per WP:DYK: \"_DYK is not: A smaller-scale version of either featured content or Good Articles, though selected Good Articles do appear in the DYK box. Articles must meet the basic criteria set out on this page but do not have to be of very high quality. It is fine for articles to be incomplete (though not unfinished), to have red links, to be capable of being expanded or improved further, and so on._\" So, please leave this pending for now and I'll request another review when I've made another round of editing, which will add the specific content mentioned by Fram.

(talk) 14:56, 16 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n    \n\n  * Well, no, our objectives aren't aligned. Your objective is to a) have this article as a DYK and b) have it finished to a basic acceptable state at some date in the future. My objective is to have a) articles with a basic acceptable state, and b) only if they then also meet DYK standards, to have them as a DYK. The priority is the article, not the DYK, and you seem to have completely reversed that, leaving an article woefully incomplete for weeks (or longer) in the mainspace without any problem, as long as it meets the newness and length criteria of DYK so you can nominate it. Using Althea McNish(your only edit: [3]) as an excuse is pretty weak. I do notice the first comment at Template:Did you know nominations/Althea McNish, which you co-created: \"Em, you two seem to be considerably experienced editors, so you should have known better than to submit something like this.\" I'm not asking for a GA, far from it, but a DYK article, certainly by well-estalished editors with sufficient DYK credits already, should meet the basic requirements of what an article should be like, not just the very minimal literal DYK requirements. An article that has facts in the lead which aren't explained further in the body is one of the most basic fails. An article which goes on at length about the background, but skips the essentials completely, is even worse. If you don't have enough time to finish these articles before submitting them (to the mainspace and to DYK), use your sandbox or the Draft namespace instead. Fram (talk) 15:12, 16 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n    \n\n  * **Comment**.

Justlettersandnumbers (talk) 22:14, 16 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n    \n\n  * It's not unusual for articles to be reviewed more than once. When I do a QPQ, I usually go to the section Wikipedia_talk:Did_you_know#Old_nominations_needing_DYK_reviewers to find a topic. These old ones, by their nature, often have a complex history \u2013 that's why they tend to get passed over. I'm not afraid to tackle these tough nuts and, in this case, didn't just review the article but took it to AFD where the page was turned into a redirect. That was a significant amount of effort \u2013 more onerous than many other QPQs that I've done. Andrew D. (talk) 22:48, 16 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n    ![Symbol delete vote.svg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_delete_vote.svg/16px-Symbol_delete_vote.svg.png) Andrew Davidson, apart from from you, the nominator and the reviewer, seven others contributed to that discussion (I was one of them). Do you think that all of them can claim it as a QPQ? I don't. I suggest you revise your QPQ for this nomination. Oh, and I don't plan to claim this comment as a review, either. Justlettersandnumbers (talk) 11:11, 17 March 2016 (UTC) \n\n    \n\n  * My position remains that this was a valid QPQ. I went looking for something to review and found that topic on a list specifically entitled \"Old_nominations_needing_DYK_reviewers\". If one picks an open entry from that list and does work culminating in a DYK decision like {{DYKno}} then this is a review. If one got no credit for such work then the old nominations with complex history and issues would be neglected. Anyway, my first priority is to expand the article which I hope to do at the weekend. Before I spend any time on another messy QPQ like the guy ropes case, I'd want a second opinion or some evidence that this is necessary. Andrew D.

This may mean that more than one person can be given QPQ credit for reviewing a particular nomination, as happened here. In this case, a new assessment was requested, and Andrew D.'s review noted a fundamental flaw in the article itself, which was affirmed over the course of the AfD, after which point the article was removed and replaced with a redirect to a completely different topic.

It's a good illustration in the article but I would be surprised if it would be used on the main page due to difficulty in making out what is going on in it at thumbnail size.

Gatoclass (talk) 05:31, 15 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n    \n\n    I don't find the use of broken English to mock Chinese people very funny, even if it's in good fun. The joke ought to be in the _content_, and not through offensive delivery. Kingoflettuce (talk) 05:51, 15 March 2016 (UTC) \n\n    A couple of days ago you were blowing off concerns about possible offence to others. You can't have it both ways. Gatoclass (talk) 08:46, 15 March 2016 (UTC) \n\n    I think ALT3 is great for April Fools Day. Far less offensive than slurs on women and gays which this year's April Fools page seems to be attracting from this editor. Yoninah (talk) 09:33, 15 March 2016 (UTC) \n\n    That's faulty logic. I wasn't the one who wrote 'bitch on heat', whereas you're the one mimicking the stereotypical Chinese. By the way there is no ALT3, only ALT2. This is perfect Western hypocrisy: since when were you the moral arbiter as to what's \"less\" offensive? Oh, lofty ideals such as protecting the rights of women and members of the LGBT community outweigh that of the Chinese (whom you probably consider aliens and look down upon for being inferior? And personally I believe strongly in the first two.) Look, say what you will, I have never ever once introduced anything offensive on my own -- all my hooks are sourced from what's present in the actual content! Whereas there is no chingchong imitation on this article. You're creating that. Who's more offensive? Kingoflettuce (talk) 10:27, 15 March 2016 (UTC)\n\nFOR THE RECORD: the nature of such stories in and of itself would be offensive\nto the unacquainted, or those from other cultures. These are merely reproduced\ntidbits from centuries ago. If the source article has offensive elements, most\nlikely the hook would be offensive to some too! Cannot be helped. But I am not\none who likes conflict and causing trouble, if you really find it unacceptable\nthen leave it be. I am also working, and have worked on, many \"non-offensive\"\narticles of considerably high quality. Don't buy into such a toxic narrative\n(intentionally or unintentionally) insinuated by some people above. Thanks.\nKingoflettuce (talk) 10:35, 15 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n    The hook is in the style of a \"Confucious say\" joke, a very well known format that has been around for decades. I've never heard of anybody, Chinese or otherwise, ever suggest that such jokes are offensive to Chinese people. But if you want to make an issue of it, I can request some wider input. Gatoclass (talk) 04:42, 17 March 2016 (UTC) \n\n    For a \"Confucious (sic) say\" joke, it certainly sucks -- no punch at all. And \"Confucius say\" jokes, funny or otherwise, are certainly not politically correct (WikiRead: BAD) and offensive to many, if not majority of, ethnic Chinese. Who came up with these jokes? Certainly not Chinese. Have never heard? Well now you have. Would you dare pull off a similar stunt for, say, an African American-related hook? Funny creole j'macian yow? Goes without saying, right? But, of course, it's less pertinent when it comes to us Chinese. Yawn. Kingoflettuce (talk) 07:39, 17 March 2016 (UTC) \n\n    p.s. I enjoy the _content_ of select Confucius say jokes.

The most relevant passage is translated by \"Google translate\" as \"Sometime were 6,500 Italians in Wolfsburg, and in the seventies about 10,000. The number of barracks grew.

I took the wording from the article, which takes it from an offline source, so I can't check where the mistake comes from, a [sic] in the source or a copying mistake. I can tell you, being a native speaker of German, that \"wondrous passion\" is a rather unpoetic translation of \"Wonneschauer\" (\"showers of bliss\" would come closer), so I would not want to use it. The composer is intentionally not linked, readers being expected to click on St\u00e4ndchen, not Strauss, where they will certainly find a link. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 07:25, 16 March 2016 (UTC) \n\n    OK understood..

Gatoclass (talk) 08:03, 8 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n    _That_ wouldn't work, and you'd know if you read the article and understand Chinese. Kingoflettuce (talk) 15:21, 8 March 2016 (UTC) \n\n    And the point of it being seemingly ungrammatical is of itself _the point_! As with the other hooks for various other _Liaozhai_ noms... I would find longer hooks less interesting, and to some extent boring, at least in such cases (He is gay would defo get more clicks than...what?), but no offence and thanks for being a friendly random second reviewer of sorts! Kingoflettuce (talk) 15:24, 8 March 2016 (UTC) \n\n    Sorry, but an ungrammatical hook makes no \"point\" other than that the sentence needs a copyedit. And this has nothing to do with \"understanding Chinese\". The \"joke\", in both your original hook and mine, is that \"You\" is not the second-person pronoun it appears to be in the hook, but the name of a story. The difference between the hooks IMO is that the phrase \"is followed by you\" in the original hook is clunky because it's unnatural - nobody talks like that. Saying \"the Frog God is within you\", however, is a perfectly natural phrase that echoes a common sentiment that God is within oneself. As such, I think it's a more elegant play on words - and therefore funnier. Gatoclass (talk) 22:19, 8 March 2016 (UTC) \n\n    Upon further thought, the original hooks (mine + ALT1) are _perfectly_ grammatical. \"The Frog God is within you\" -- where is that found in the article?? It is _before_, not _within_, at the very least. I still think You follows Frog god is a great hook. Thanks Kingoflettuce (talk) 23:11, 8 March 2016 (UTC) \n\n    Well yes, the first two hooks are grammatical if you maintain the capital Y for \"You\" and put it in quotemarks. But then it defeats the purpose of being an April Fools hook because it is obvious that \"You\" is just another story.\n    As for your other objection - your hook is based on the fact that the story \"You\" follows sequentially from \"The Frog God\" in the anthology. My hook is based on the fact that the Frog God is a character who appears within the story \"You\". Gatoclass (talk) 23:21, 8 March 2016 (UTC) \n\n    \n\n    Oh, so I see. But that's not the point of the article! The sequel, so to speak, doesn't even have a page. (And I'm unable to start one for various reasons, I.e. accessibility and time) Anyway, I feel the hook should concern THIS story and not the other. Kingoflettuce (talk) 12:36, 9 March 2016 (UTC) \n\n    Oh, come on. My proposed hook is no more or less relevant than yours. Gatoclass (talk) 04:15, 10 March 2016 (UTC) \n\n    I might like to reserve your hook for the nom of a potential article on You, and not this. Hooks should be based on the Main article and not what is secondary to it. What if the Frog God didn't appear in You? My hook would still have worked. Kingoflettuce (talk) 07:13, 11 March 2016 (UTC) \n\n    Again, your hook is no more based on \"the main article\" than mine. Your argument, in short, is completely groundless. But since you seem determined to find cause for disagreement, we are going to have to leave this nomination to be resolved by somebody else. Gatoclass (talk) 08:54, 11 March 2016 (UTC) \n\n    \n\n    Believe me, I wouldn't start a debate for the fun of it. The subject/object displacement between the two hooks is what I am not pleased with. To demonstrate:\n\n... that Movie X is followed by Movie Y? VS ... that Movie Y features Z\ncharacter? The focus and subject of the hooks are completely different. I'd be\ncool if the nommed article was not on the Frog God _story_ but the Frog God\n_fictional character_. The original hook, while being quirky for April 1,\nstays true to that _principle_. You seem to be am experienced pedian, so you'd\nought to understand where I'm coming from.

Ashorocetus (talk | contribs) 13:48, 13 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n  * **ALT3:** ... that **The Frog God** precedes You?\n\n    \n\n    I still think \"the Frog God is within you\", per ALT2 above, is a better hook because it echoes the well-known saying that \"God is within you\". But I don't want to waste more time on this - the choice of hook can be left up to the promoter. However, we are still waiting for someone to verify the proposed hooks.

Both these are not even factoids and are certainly uncertain ones. \u2014**Vensatry** **(Talk)** 06:46, 6 March 2016 (UTC) \n\n    @Magentic Manifestations: Can you come up with a Stanes-based hook? \u2014**Vensatry** **(Talk)** 06:58, 6 March 2016 (UTC) \n\n    When I checked the sources I thought they (the quotes) were quite similar meaning wise so I thought it won't be that of a big deal.

Earwig noted no problems with paraphrasing. The hook is interesting, concise and supported by the reference, but the article needs to elaborate on why a person born in London and who seems to have lived her entire life in England should be considered Welsh on the basis of her parents' place of birth. QPQ completed. Espresso Addict (talk) 05:12, 8 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n    \n\n    The Welsh Dictionary of Biography run by the National Library considers her to be Welsh. We call her British. The sources states the hook. We could change it to \"of Welsh descent\" but that isn't what the source says.\u2666 _Dr. Blofeld_ 10:10, 8 March 2016 (UTC) \n\n    The ODNB states her _parents_ were \"of Welsh descent\" and also later states of her publications: \"Many relate to Wales, where her credentials as historian were backed up by family connections, a reading knowledge of Welsh, and cordial relationships with archivists throughout the principality\" so I think the claim for her being herself Welsh is disputed amongst reliable sources. Can another hook be found? The ODNB has some detail that isn't in the article -- I could e-mail it to you if you can't access it. ETA: A closer reading of the ODNB entry suggests the chair is also incorrect -- she became a reader in 1919 and a professor in 1925, both of which would, as far as I know, be lesser positions than a chair.

Nominated by Checkingfax (talk) at 09:55, 11 March 2016\n(UTC).\n\n    \n\n  * This is not a complete review, but I want to point out the fact in this hook (i.e. that 3.4% of Planned Parenthood's services are abortions) was explicitly stated to be a misleading statistic in the source. Even though the hook does clarify it's counting discrete services, I note that the Washington Post article cited states that it (and a 94% statistic claimed by Susan B. Anthony List) are \"meaningless and incomplete comparisons to make their argument, and the public should be wary of both figures\". Ashorocetus (talk | contribs) 22:37, 11 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n    \n\n  * Hi Ashorocetus. Thank you for your comments. I will be moving that source that you mention as it is not germane to the small tidbit of number crunching in the hook. The other numbers (revenue, number of patients, etc.) are further crunched in the body of the article. The SBA List is referring to revenue whereas in the lead the reference used in the hook is to the total number of discrete-services provided. I just took the 300K+ divided by the 9M+ and multiplied it by 100 to get the simple non-refutable statistic of discrete-services vs abortions. When readers click on the hook they will find out more\u200d\u2014\u200clike each patient averages three discrete-services, and that 12% of patients receive abortions. Cheers! `{{u|Checkingfax}}\u00a0{Talk}` 00:23, 12 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n    \n\n  * I am not disputing the accuracy of the number. I am saying that saying abortion is only 3% of discrete services that Planned Parenthood does is not a statistic relevant to anything. Even if you move the source, its point remains. It would be far more informative to include the 12% statistic in the hook. Ashorocetus (talk | contribs) 06:52, 12 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n    \n\n  * Hi Ashorocetus. Per your comments I have added an ALT-1. Please feel free to craft an ALT-2. For brevity I also removed some cruft. Additionally, per the DYK guidelines I added a cogent image. Cheers! `{{u|Checkingfax}}\u00a0{Talk}` 03:00, 13 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n    \n\n  * Thanks. I think it would be even better to cut the 3.4% statistic from the hook entirely because it doesn't really mean anything. I would either use the raw number of abortions, or the percentage of the clients, and not both to keep it concise. Ashorocetus (talk | contribs) 03:37, 13 March 2016 (UTC)\n  * **ALT2**: ... that **Planned Parenthood**, formed 100 years ago in Brooklyn by Margaret Sanger _(pictured)_, performs 9.5 million services per year in the U.S., including 324,000 abortions?\n  * **ALT3**: ... that **Planned Parenthood**, formed 100 years ago in Brooklyn by Margaret Sanger _(pictured)_, sees over 2.5 million patients per year in the U.S., with 12% of their clients receiving abortions?\n  * **ALT4**: ... that **Planned Parenthood**, formed 100 years ago in Brooklyn by Margaret Sanger _(pictured)_, performs 9.5 million services per year in the U.S., with 3.4% being abortions?\n\n    Again, I have the same objection to ALT4; the 3.4% statistic, while technically true, is misleading. I think including it is both uninteresting (because it is making comparisons between services that are not comparable) and it can give readers a false impression of the significance of abortions for Planned Parenthood (I quote from the article: \"Given that each patient receives about three services on average, the percent of abortions provided out of the total services provided\u200d\u2014\u200c3.4%\u200d\u2014\u200cmay not clearly represent the importance of abortion to PPFA.\") Ashorocetus (talk | contribs) 14:27, 20 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n  \n\n#### Zoeterwoude-Dorp\n\n  * ( Review or comment\n  * Article history )\n\n![An eastern entrance to Zoeterwoude-\nDorp](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Zoeterwoude_019.jpg\n/120px-Zoeterwoude_019.jpg)\n\nAn eastern entrance to Zoeterwoude-Dorp\n\n  * ... that the Dutch village of **Zoeterwoude-Dorp** (_pictured_) was built in the 13th century around a church dedicated to English missionary Saint Lebuinus?\n\n    \n\n  * _Reviewed_: Template:Did you know nominations/Climatic regions of Argentina\n\n5x expanded by Amberrock (talk).

But the article has some problems with NPOV and tone. For example, \"Once the camp was open for a while it was clear that something was amiss\" is pretty strong editorializing; there's also a lot of \"only\" language, ie, \"the Azraq refugee camp still had only around 18,500 refugees.\" Can you run through the article to adjust the tone to be more in line with WP:NPOV? --Owlsmcgee (talk) 23:03, 13 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n    \n\n  * Thanks for doing the review. I've replaced the sentence you objected to and I've added something about a new electricity project coming this year. But I don't see a reason to take out usages of \"only\". That the camp doesn't have nearly as many refugees as planned for, despite no shortage of refugees from the war, is a simple objective fact and the central point of interest for nearly every news story about the camp after the time of its opening.

My sole reservation with this nomination is the veracity of the hook. According to the article, Black Allan never raced, so he never failed as a racehorse. He just never competed. Besides, even if true, it's a bland hook. It seems to me that with readers' expectations aroused by 'racehorse', a really catchy hook could be crafted playing off Black Allan's 'running' and 'walking'. This is an interesting article that deserves a fascinating hook.Georgejdorner (talk) 19:04, 18 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n    \n\n    \n\n  * How's this for a new hook:\n\n  * **ALT1**...that **Black Allan's** running walk made him ineligible as a racehorse but desirable as a breeding stallion?\n\n    \n\n    \n\n  * A racehorse isn't made just by competing in races. They usually go through at least a year of training before they even see a real track, and to be worth anything at all they have to be bred to race as well. He was, through the Standardbred bloodline, although Morgans used to be raced a lot as well. He just had the genetic glitch that produced the Walking Horse gait, passed it down, and now we have the whole breed. Pinging Montanabw for more ideas.

LavaBaron (talk) 22:11, 20 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n    \n\n    PDF is just a reproduction of the _Mencius_ text, from which most info of Yi Qiu may be gleaned.

The same claim is made elsewhere in the recesses of the Web. Unfortunately, him being an ancient figure, there isn't anything much left to be written of. If you disagree with the translation of sources (I admit I am not so proficient either -- we are what you may call 'bananas') please tweak it, but I guarantee the intended meaning is there.

There are probably others. Edwardx (talk) 18:43, 19 March 2016 (UTC)\n    Of course I know, he was quite a famous actor. The hook is still incorrect as it implies that his death is the cause for the first film in franchise without him when in fact he has previously not appeared in a film in the franchise when alive. It's also not interesting because of that. For ALT1: the American production _Papa_ (2015) filmed in Cuba before this film so also incorrect.[[11]] Cowlibob (talk) 20:03, 19 March 2016 (UTC) \n\n    ![Symbol confirmed.svg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Symbol_confirmed.svg/16px-Symbol_confirmed.svg.png) GTG as previously stated.

Also some \"also\" is missing: it is mainly a parish church. Holding not one but two important altars is something unique. There are plenty of images of the Marienaltar on the commons, no need to hold this one on which you see no details,- it pictures the church. - We can drop the destruction, but unfortunately that's what gets clicked.

Voceditenore (talk) 15:08, 10 February 2016 (UTC) \n\n    I saw the additions with delight, but - see above - they would make even more sense in an article about the altar itself, which I would like to see on DYK on 25 March which is this year both Annunciation and Good Friday. You could start it already now, - I have a few other things waiting first. The link to the German article is in the church. Anyway, you get make credit for this, thank you very much! --Gerda Arendt (talk) 15:23, 10 February 2016 (UTC)# \n\n    But Gerda, the \"Swooning Virgin\" is depicted on the Berswordtaltar\u00a0(de), not the Marienaltar, so this hook wouldn't interfere with a future DYK about the Marienaltar. I also have to say that a church having two notable altar pieces is not at all unusual, although perhaps in Germany? In Italy and Spain, it certainly isn't.

We probably can't hold it that long? --Gerda Arendt (talk) 17:05, 10 February 2016 (UTC) \n\n    There's a close up detail of just the \"Swoon\" which might be better in the small size. I'm not sure. But if you still don't want the Swooning Virgin in a hook, how about this one? Not nearly as catchy but it's referenced...\n\n  * **ALT4**: ~~... that the medieval altar pieces of the now-rebuilt **Marienkirche** in Dortmund spent World War II in a castle thus saving them from the bombing that destroyed the church?~~\n\n    Voceditenore (talk) 17:32, 10 February 2016 (UTC) \n\n    Nice (and a dear person was baptised in that castle), but I like the swoon better, especially with the close-up image. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 17:50, 10 February 2016 (UTC) \n\n    \n\n  * I think you should go for a double hook (Marienkirche and Marienaltar), with the swoon image, for Good Friday, which is 6 weeks away. I believe 6 weeks is the maximum for holding a hook for a special occasion. Yoninah (talk) 19:05, 10 February 2016 (UTC)\n\n    \n\n  * No, thanks, I don't like double-hooks. As Voceditenore pointed out, this one with the smaller image can go rightaway (it's a January article), - hook and image are from the Bendswordtaltar, so the other could still go later. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 20:19, 10 February 2016 (UTC)\n\n    \n\n  * So do you want ALT3 or ALT4 for this nomination?

This should be added to the article and be the subject of the hook. Sources that support Romney's speech being unprecedented are many, but include this CNN piece and this NPR story and this RealClearPolitics article and this Business Insider piece and this KING 5 TV story and this New York Times story. For the historical perspective, this other New York Times story features some historians trying to find parallels and having to go back about a century to even find something sort of close. Once this aspect of the speech is added to the article, the hook could be something like: \n\n  * **ALT2**: ... that **Mitt Romney's March 3 speech** represented an unprecedented attack by a major U.S. party's most recent presidential nominee against the party's current front-runner for the nomination?\n    Finally, note that there is no bar to current political articles going up as DYK's and thus this does not need to get held over. For example, Mitt Romney presidential campaign, 2012 and Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016 both went up on the DYK main page shortly after those candidacies were announced; see the DYK banners at the top of their respective talk pages. Wasted Time R (talk) 13:46, 5 March 2016 (UTC) \n\n    Feel free to add that to the article, WP is edited by people like you and me, not some mysterious force. Until it's added, though, your ALT2 hook isn't supported by the content of the article. LavaBaron (talk) 18:44, 5 March 2016 (UTC) \n\n    I have now added the material to the article that supports this hook. I think ALT2 is the better hook because the unprecedented nature of the speech will remain true no matter what happens, whereas ALT1 is based on loose speculation that will become dated. Note also that I have added myself to the DYK credits since this was a significant contribution (I've added others on to DYK's that I've nominated in similar situations.) Wasted Time R (talk) 00:23, 6 March 2016 (UTC) \n\n    I endorse Wasted Time R's ALT-2 hook. I take no position on whether this should be held until June.

The article has attracted some controversy, of course, but no deal-breaker problems (And we want to be sure we make a good deal after all .... sorry\u00a0:) ). I don't have an opinion about the timing issue mentioned above and will leave that to the editors promoting/scheduling the hook. I do want to say that I'm operating under an assumption that I hope someone will call out if it's incorrect: the hook is _very_ US-centric in the information it omits. My assumption is that because we're linking to the Super Tuesday, Cruz, and Rubio articles, it's ok to omit the fact that we're talking about the 2016 US Presidential election/candidates. Apologies if that's a bad presumption (only my second DYK review).

A few days later, on 17 March\n2016, however the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons (TAK) claimed responsibility, a\ngroup had already claimed the previous Ankara bombing in February. TAK however\ninsisted that, like the previous bombing, the recent attack was aimed at\nsecurity forces rather than at civilians.[2]\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Background\n    * 1.1 Intelligence\n  * 2 Attack\n    * 2.1 Perpetrator\n  * 3 Reactions\n    * 3.1 Domestic\n    * 3.2 International\n  * 4 Aftermath\n  * 5 See also\n  * 6 References\n\n## Background[edit]\n\nThe attack came at a time when Turkey was facing multiple security threats. It\nis a member of the coalition fighting against the Islamic State of Iraq and\nthe Levant. There also is an ongoing conflict in the country's southeast with\nthe Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), following the collapse of a truce in July\n2015. This attack was the third major attack in Ankara in six months, less\nthan a month earlier on 17 February, another bombing had killed 29 in central\nAnkara. That attack was claimed by the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons\n(TAK).[15][16]\n\n### Intelligence[edit]\n\nOn 27 February, Ankara Police conducted searches for a car bomb in the K\u0131z\u0131lay\narea. There had been Turkish intelligence about 6 bomb-laden cars that were\nbeing prepared for an attack by the PKK and there was an active search at the\ntime of the attack for these vehicles in eastern and southeastern Turkey.[17]\n\nThe United States embassy in Ankara had warned its citizens about a possible\nattack in the city on 11 March. However, the warning had indicated the\nBah\u00e7elievler area as the likely site of the attack, which is located at the\nsame district as K\u0131z\u0131lay where the attack took place.[3][7] The Intelligence\nDepartment of the Turkish Armed Forces also reported in a document a \"specific\nwarning to a possible terror attack in Ankara, mentioning areas near the blast\nsite of the explosion\".[18]\n\n## Attack[edit]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/K%C4%B1z%C4%B1lay_Anka\nra_kent_meydan%C4%B1.jpg/200px-K%C4%B1z%C4%B1lay_Ankara_kent_meydan%C4%B1.jpg)\n\nThe area where the attack occurred (right-head: K\u0131z\u0131lay Square and G\u00fcvenpark)\n\nThe area hit serves as a transport hub in the city, where a number of bus\nlines meet.[16] A number of bus stops are present at the site, which is next\nto G\u00fcvenpark and next to the K\u0131z\u0131lay Square, considered the heart of Ankara.\nIt is one of the most crowded areas of Ankara with metro and Ankaray stations\nalso having exits at the area. The Ministry of National Education, the Court\nof Cassation and the former Prime Ministry building are all close to the site\nof the bombing.[19]\n\nA car bomb was used for the attack. According to the state channel, TRT, the\ncar hit a bus carrying 20 civilians.[8] An eyewitness stated that while a bus,\ncarrying 40 people, slowed down, the car exploded whilst going by it.[7]\nAccording to an official cited by Reuters, a BMW driven from the southeastern\npredominantly Kurdish-inhabited city of Viran\u015fehir was used in the attack.[8]\nThe bomb was packed with nails and pellets to maximise the damage.[20] The\nexplosions could be heard from kilometers away and resulted in a shower of\ndebris in an area extending for a few hundred meters.[8]\n\n### Perpetrator[edit]\n\nTurkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davuto\u011flu said that there was \"very serious\nevidence\" that suggested that PKK was responsible for the attack.[21] The\nMinistry of the Interior identified Seher \u00c7a\u011fla Demir, a PKK affiliate\nstudying at Bal\u0131kesir University, as the assailant. Demir was born in 1992 in\nKa\u011f\u0131zman, Kars Province and had reportedly joined the organization in 2013.\nShe was being tried, along with four others, for spreading PKK propaganda, and\nhad allegedly crossed into Syria to be trained by the YPG.[22] According to\nher father, Demir's family had lost contact with her when she enrolled in\nBal\u0131kesir University in 2012.[23] The claims about Demir's identity as the\nperpetrator were first reported by the newspaper _S\u00f6zc\u00fc_.[14] It has been\nclaimed by the Turkish media that there was a male militant accompanying\nDemir. 11 people were arrested in connection to the attack, and arrest\nwarrants issued for 10 others.[24] As PKK had only directly struck security\nforces during the period prior to the attack and claimed that it does not\ntarget civilians, _The Guardian_ commented that if PKK claimed responsibility\nfor the attack, it would represent a major tactical shift.[25]\n\nAccording to Turkish media, the car used was a 1995 model BMW that had been\nstolen in Viran\u015fehir on 10 January and taken that day to Diyarbak\u0131r. It\nreportedly had an Istanbul plate number, and was owned by an elderly woman. On\n26 February, the car reportedly arrived in Ankara.[17]\n\nOn 17 March 2016, the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons (TAK), that had also been\nresponsible for the previous Ankara bombing in February, claimed\nresponsibility for the attack. TAK also identified the bomber as Seher \u00c7a\u011fla\nDemir.[26] While the group insisted killing civilians was not intended in an\nattack they said was aimed at security forces, they warned further civilian\ncasualties were inevitable.[2] The location of the bombing was 10 to 20 metres\nfrom the closest police station.[26] The correspondent of France24 in Turkey\ncommented on TAK's statement by saying \"morally that holds no water because\nthere were scores of civilians at that bus terminus\".[26] TAK claims that it\nhas split from the PKK, but it is controversial whether the groups are\nlinked;[27] many sources consider TAK to be affiliated to the PKK.[26][28]\n\n## Reactions[edit]\n\n### Domestic[edit]\n\n  * A security summit headed by Prime Minister Ahmet Davuto\u011flu convened after the attack.[29] After the summit, Efkan Ala, the Minister of the Interior, deplored the attack and said that although solid evidence had been reached about the perpetrators of the attack, a certain announcement would be made the next day.[30]\n  * President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan made a statement, in which he said \"terror is resorting to the most immoral and heartless ways\" and \"our citizens should not fear, for the fight against terrorism all our national institutions are carrying out in solidarity with the nation will indubitably end in success\".[31]\n  * Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, the leader of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), wrote that this was a \"terrorist attack that should be condemned without saying 'but' or 'however'\".[32]\n  * The pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) issued a statement condemning the attack. In the statement it shared \"the huge pain felt along with our citizens\".[33]\n  * Devlet Bah\u00e7eli, head of the Nationalist Movement Party, wrote that \"no terrorist attack can bring Turkey on its knees\", that the Turkish nation was united against \"the plans of the brutes, the calculations of the troublemakers and the merchants of death\" and that \"the hotbeds of treason will not only be humiliated, but will also pay for this\".[34]\n  * Protesters in Istanbul's Taksim Square attempted to hold a commemoration for the victims. The protesters were dispersed by the police using pepper spray and some protesters were arrested.[35]\n  * Following the bombing, national mourning was not declared. Mahmut Tanal, a member of the parliament from the CHP, proposed three days of national mourning to the parliament.[36]\n  * Abd\u00fclkadir Selvi, Ankara representative of the pro-government newspaper _Yeni \u015eafak_, said \"Yes, it hurts, but we have to learn to live with terror for a while\" on the TV channel NTV. His words were widely criticized on social media.[37]\n  * Pro-government newspaper _Milat_ covered the attack only as a sub-heading on its main page. Its main story was the results of a poll that indicated majority support for the executive presidency of Erdo\u011fan, with the title \"President Erdo\u011fan\". The newspaper was heavily criticized as the topic became one of the most popular on Twitter.[38]\n\n### International[edit]\n\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b9/Flag_of_Australia.svg/23px-Flag_of_Australia.svg.png)\u00a0Australia: Australia's Ambassador to Turkey, James Larsen, was in his car with his daughter about 20m from the explosion when the bomb went off on the other side of the traffic lights where they were stopped.[39] The Foreign Minister of Australia Julie Bishop spoke to the Ambassador soon after the incident, got his first hand report, and condemned the bombing.[40]\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cf/Flag_of_Canada.svg/23px-Flag_of_Canada.svg.png)\u00a0Canada: Global Affairs Canada stated that \"Canada is appalled by this latest, senseless attack in Ankara.

The statement said: \"Our thoughts and prayers go out to those killed and injured as well as to their loved ones. This horrific act is only the most recent of many terrorist attacks perpetrated against the Turkish people\". The statement continued with: \"The United States stands together with Turkey, a NATO ally and valued partner, as we confront the scourge of terrorism.\"[42]\n\n## Aftermath[edit]\n\nFollowing the attack, nine F-16s and four F-4s of the Turkish Air Force raided\n18 PKK positions in Iraqi Kurdistan. The areas raided included the Qandil\nMountains, the base of PKK leadership.[53] 36 suspected members of PKK or the\naffiliated Group of Communities in Kurdistan (KCK) were arrested in 45\ndifferent operations in Adana Province.[54] Overall, 79 people were taken into\ncustody throughout the country.[21]\n\nThere was not a major response from the financial markets to the attack as the\nvalue of the Turkish lira receded slightly against US dollar. However, the\ndeteriorating safety situation in Turkey caused major concerns about tourism\nand led to the analysis that the country is \"not yet safe for long-term\ninvestors\".[20]\n\nOnly six days later, another suicide bombing hit the busy \u0130stiklal Avenue in\nIstanbul, causing the deaths of four victims.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * January 2016 Istanbul bombing\n  * March 2016 Istanbul bombing\n  * List of terrorist incidents, January\u2013June 2016\n  * Internet Censorship in Turkey\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. **^** \"Explosion in Ankara Kills at Least 34, Turkish Officials Say\".

The attack occurred at 10:55 (EET)\nat the intersection of Balo Street with \u0130stiklal Avenue,[3] a central shopping\nstreet,[4] causing at least five deaths,[5] including that of the perpetrator.\n36 people were injured, including seven whose injuries were heavy.[3][4] Among\nthose injured were twelve foreign tourists.[4] Among those killed, two were of\ndual Israel-US nationality.[6]\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Background\n  * 2 Attack\n    * 2.1 Victims\n    * 2.2 Perpetrator\n  * 3 Reactions\n    * 3.1 Domestic\n    * 3.2 International\n  * 4 See also\n  * 5 References\n\n## Background[edit]\n\nThe bombing was the fourth suicide bombing in Turkey in 2016,[7] and occurred\nsix days after a bombing in Ankara that left 37 people dead. The United States\nembassy in Ankara had issued a terrorism warning to its citizens the day\nbefore the bombing for Istanbul, Ankara, \u0130zmir and Adana. The German embassy\nhad also issued a security warning to its citizens three days before the\nbombing. Prime Minister Ahmet Davuto\u011flu had called the warnings \"normal\".[8]\nGermany had also closed its consulate on the avenue on Thursday and Friday as\na security measure.[9]\n\nAccording to BBC, residents of Istanbul had already been vigilant before the\nattack due to the recent explosion in Ankara and were wary of going out.[9]\nFollowing the bombing, according to _Cumhuriyet_, the Turkish government\nreceived heavy criticism on social media for defects in security.[8]\n\n## Attack[edit]\n\nThe bombing took place on \u0130stiklal Avenue, a shopping area popular with\ntourists and considered the busiest avenue in Turkey.[4][10] However, the\nbombing took place at a time when the avenue was relatively quiet.[5] The site\nof detonation was a few hundred metres away from a place where police buses\nare usually parked.[7] According to an eyewitness, the bomber detonated the\nbomb whilst passing by a group of tourists.[3] Hundreds of people reportedly\nran away from the site of attack in panic after the explosion.[11] Nails and\nsmall pieces of metal were reportedly scattered in the area due to the\nattack.[12] Following the bombing, the avenue was closed off to the\npublic.[10] According to a CNN T\u00fcrk reporter on the scene, the suicide\nattacker was on his way to the actual target when the bomb went off in front\nof a restaurant.[13] According to a Turkish official cited by Reuters, the\nbomber was \"deterred\" from his or her actual target by the police and set off\nthe bomb \"out of fear\". Initial findings pointed to Kurdish perpetrators.[14]\n\n### Victims[edit]\n\nAccording to _H\u00fcrriyet_, three of the victims killed were Israeli and one was\nIranian.[3] One of the victims that died in the explosion was a child. Two of\nthe tourists injured were also children.[12]\n\nVictims by nationality[15] Nationality | Deaths | Wounded | Total | Ref.  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Flag_of_Turkey.svg\n/23px-Flag_of_Turkey.svg.png)\u00a0Turkey | 0 | 24 | 25 | [15]  \n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Flag_of_Israel.svg\n/21px-Flag_of_Israel.svg.png)\u00a0Israel | 3 | 6 | 9 | [3][15][16]  \n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.s\nvg/23px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png)\u00a0USA | 2 | 0 | 2 | [16]  \n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Flag_of_Iran.svg/23px-\nFlag_of_Iran.svg.png)\u00a0Iran | 1 | 1 | 2 | [3][15]  \n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Flag_of_Ireland.svg\n/23px-Flag_of_Ireland.svg.png)\u00a0Ireland | 0 | 2 | 2 | [15]  \n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/ba/Flag_of_Germany.svg/23px-\nFlag_of_Germany.svg.png)\u00a0Germany | 0 | 1 | 1 | [15]  \n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Flag_of_Iceland.svg\n/21px-Flag_of_Iceland.svg.png)\u00a0Iceland | 0 | 1 | 1 | [15]  \n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Flag_of_the_United_Ara\nb_Emirates.svg/23px-Flag_of_the_United_Arab_Emirates.svg.png)\u00a0United Arab\nEmirates | 0 | 1 | 1 | [15]  \n**Total** | **4**[note 1] | **36** | **41** |   \n  \n  1. **^** Two victims hold a dual citizenship thus being counted twice in the per-country figure but only once in the totals.\n\nIsraeli authorities identified the three Israeli victims as the 40 years old\nYonatan Suher from Tel Aviv, 60 years old Simcha Dimri from Dimona and 69\nyears old Avraham Goldman from Ramat Hasharon.[16]\n\n### Perpetrator[edit]\n\nWhile the authorities were quick to blame the Kurdistan Workers' Party\n(PKK),[14] only upon further investigation in the afternoon, the Turkish\nauthorities changed their initial assessment, now instead holding the Islamic\nState of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) accountable.[17] According to _Milliyet,_\nTurkish authorities never ruled out ISIL as suspects early on. According to\nthe newspaper, the fact that the attack occurred near a group of tourists\nindeed suggested an ISIL involvement.[18] PKK umbrella organization KCK said\nit opposed targeting civilians and condemned attacks on them.[19]\n\nThe next day, Turkish authorities announced that Mehmet \u00d6zt\u00fcrk was reliably\nidentified by DNA tests to be the suicide bomber of the Istanbul attack. Born\n1992 in Gaziantep Province and thought to be affiliated with ISIL,[1][2] he\nwas one of two Turkish suspects the authorities were investigating. The day\nbefore, _Sabah_ had named \u00d6zturk and 33 years old ISIL militant Sava\u015f Y\u0131ld\u0131z\nfrom Adana,[20][21] who is also thought to be involved in the October 2015\nAnkara bombings killing more than 100 civilians. In the night, authorities\narrested Y\u0131ld\u0131z' parents.[17][22]\n\n## Reactions[edit]\n\n### Domestic[edit]\n\n  * Following the attack, a meeting headed by Prime Minister Davuto\u011flu convened in Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace for \"evaluation\".[23]\n  * RT\u00dcK, the Turkish board that regulates radios and TV channels, issued a ban on broadcasting images from the scene of attack.[24]\n  * Koma Civaken Kurdistan announced that they are against the targeting of civilians, and condemned attacks that are carried out in this way.[25]\n  * Selahattin Demirta\u015f, co-chair of the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), condemned the attack and said \"the government may have got used to such attacks, but we will not\".[26]\n  * Selin Sayek B\u00f6ke, spokesperson of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), said \"today have died again\" and \"we will not get used to terror, terror will not be normalised\".[27]\n  * A number of Turkish people expressed their gratitude to Germany for warning about the attack, which they claim may have prevented more deaths, and reacted to the denial of a threat by Turkish authorities by using the hashtag #DankeSch\u00f6nDeutschland (\"Thank you very much Germany\" in German), which became trending in Turkey, on Twitter.[28]\n  * Vasip \u015eahin, governor of Istanbul, claimed in response that the attack was not related to the warning given by the German consulate.[29]\n  * Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmu\u015f, in a statement criticised by _Cumhuriyet_ as \"scandalous\", said that this was \"a test in which, thanks to God, our citizens are performing very well\".[30]\n  * Turkish official \u0130rem Akta\u015f was reportedly fired after tweeting that she wished death upon the Israeli tourists injured in the suicide bombing.[31][32]\n\n### International[edit]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg/23px-\nFlag_of_France.svg.png)\u00a0France: Jean-Marc Ayrault, France's Foreign Minister,\ncondemned the bombing, saying \"I strongly condemn this despicable and cowardly\nact that has caused the death of several people,\" while adding that Paris\nstood in solidarity with Turkey.[33]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Flag_of_Greece.svg\n/23px-Flag_of_Greece.svg.png)\u00a0Greece: The Greek Foreign Ministry condemned the\nattack, releasing a statement saying, \"Greece unequivocally condemns\nterrorism, whatever its source.

On 19 March 2016, the Boeing 737-800 flying this route made two unsuccessful landing attempts at Rostov-on-Don Airport in inclement weather. After aborting its second approach, the aircraft climbed to 4,000 feet (1,200\u00a0m), then descended rapidly and crashed near the start of runway 22.[1][2] All 62 people on board the aircraft were killed in the high-speed impact. [3][4]\n\nThe crash was Flydubai's only fatal incident in its eight-year history.[5]\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Background\n    * 1.1 Aircraft\n    * 1.2 Flight crew\n    * 1.3 Weather\n  * 2 Flight\n  * 3 Victims\n  * 4 Investigation\n  * 5 Reaction\n  * 6 Notes\n  * 7 References\n  * 8 External links\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n### Aircraft[edit]\n\nThe aircraft involved was a five-year-old Boeing 737-8KN,[b] registered as\nA6-FDN,[4] MSN 40241, equipped with two CFM International CFM56 engines.[6]\nIts first flight was on 21 December 2010, and it was delivered to Flydubai on\n24 January 2011.[6] The aircraft had passed a C-grade maintenance check on 21\nJanuary 2016.[7]\n\n### Flight crew[edit]\n\nThe captain was 38-year-old Aristos Sokratous, from Cyprus.[8] He had 5,965\nhours of total flying time,[9] with 5,000 hours being the minimum required for\na captain at Flydubai.[10][11] Sokratous was promoted to captain a year and a\nhalf before the crash.[8] At the time of the crash, he was going to quit the\nairline after accepting a job from Ryanair, which would allow him to be based\nwith his family in Cyprus.[12] His wife was due to give birth to their first\nchild a few weeks after the crash.[8]\n\nThe first officer, 37-year-old Alejandro Cruz Alava, was Spanish.[13] He had\n5,769 hours of flying time.[9] He started his career with Flydubai two years\nbefore the crash, having flown before for two regional airlines in the Spanish\nCanary Islands, Binter and Naysa.[14]\n\nBoth pilots had experience landing at Rostov-on-Don.[15]\n\n### Weather[edit]\n\nAt the time of the crash, range of wind speed in the vicinity was 14\u201322\u00a0m/s\n(27\u201343\u00a0kn; 31\u201349\u00a0mph).[16] Just before the crash, ATC reported to Flight 981\nthat wind direction was 230 degrees, wind speed 12\u00a0m/s (23\u00a0kn; 27\u00a0mph) with\ngusts to 18\u00a0m/s (35\u00a0kn; 40\u00a0mph), and visibility was 3,500\u00a0m (11,500\u00a0ft),\naccording to the ATC records published on YouTube.[17][18] Earlier in the same\nATC recording, another flight reported icing conditions.\n\nAccording to some news reports, a rare low-altitude jet stream, with a wind\nspeed above 30\u00a0m/s (58\u00a0kn; 67\u00a0mph), was observed around the airport as low as\n629 meters (2,064\u00a0ft), while normally it is observed above 5,000 meters\n(16,000\u00a0ft).[11] Some aviation safety experts suggested that a wind shear, a\nsudden change in wind speed or direction, might have contributed to the\ncrash.[19]\n\n## Flight[edit]\n\nFlight 981 was scheduled to depart from Dubai International Airport at 21:45\nlocal time (UTC+4) on 18 March 2016 and arrive at Rostov-on-Don Airport at\n1:20 local time (UTC+3) the next day.[20] It departed from Dubai with a\n35-minute delay, at 22:20.[3]\n\nAfter a four-hour flight, at 01:41 local time, the aircraft made its first\nlanding attempt, but had to abort it, due to poor weather conditions.[21] 15\nminutes before this attempt, two other flights landed successfully at Rostov-\non-Don: S7 Airlines Flight 1159 (at 01:23), and Ural Airlines Flight 2758 (at\n01:28).[11] Flight 981 went into a holding pattern near the airport, awaiting\nbetter weather conditions, for the next two hours.[21][22] It maintained 8,000\nfeet (2,400\u00a0m) for the first 30 minutes of the hold and then climbed to 15,000\nfeet (4,600\u00a0m) feet.[21] Soon after Flight 981's first aborted landing,\nAeroflot Flight 1166 made three unsuccessful attempts within 22 minutes to\nland at Rostov-on-Don, and eventually diverted to nearby Krasnodar\nInternational where it landed successfully at 02:59.[11][23][24][25]\n\nAccording to ATC communications published online, before the aircraft was\nestablished on the localizer, the instrument which indicates the center line\nof the runway when pilots are landing using instruments rather than visually,\npilots reported to ATC that in case they would need to make another go-around,\nthey would climb to flight level 80\u2014approximately 8,000 feet (2,400\u00a0m).[c]\nThey then reported that they were established on the localizer and continued\ntheir descent.[17][18] Judging by Flightradar24's data, when the aircraft was\n5.5 kilometres (3.4\u00a0mi) from the runway threshold, it started climbing again\nfrom the altitude of 1,575 feet (480 m). After reaching an altitude of 4,050\nft (1,230\u00a0m) by 3:41:37, the altitude of the aircraft decreased rapidly with a\nvertical speed reaching more than 21,000\u00a0ft/min.[26][_non-primary source\nneeded_][_contradiction_] In less than a minute, the aircraft crashed close to\nthe runway at 03:42 local time.[27][28] ATC records appeared to show that the\ncrew decided to go around moments before the crash. The pilots reported their\nintention to abort the landing with \"Going around, Skydubai[d] 981\". ATC\nadvised Flight 981 to switch to another air traffic controller (\"Skydubai 981,\ncontact Rostov Radar on 121.2\"). Flight 981 acknowledged this with \"121.2,\nbye-bye\", which was their final transmission.[17][18]\n\nAt 03:42 local time, the air traffic controller (ATC) of the airport alerted\nthe local emergency services about the crash.[29] The aircraft impacted the\nground immediately east of the approach end of Runway 22. A CCTV video,\nuploaded online after the crash, shows an aircraft making a steep descent into\nthe ground, followed by an explosion.[30]\n\nAccording to a source in the rescue team, the small radius of the expansion of\ndebris and the small size of the debris parts, points out that the speed of\nthe fall was more than 400\u00a0km/h, as the aircraft's magnesium alloy wheel rims\nwere shattered.[31] This speed assessment matches the Flightradar24 data.[32]\nAccording to the same source, the plane struck the ground at a nose-down pitch\nof about 60 degrees.[31]\n\nFlight 981 carried fuel for 8.5 hours of flight. It had been airborne for 6\nhours until the crash.[21]\n\n  *

55 passengers and 7 crew members, died in the\ncrash.[3] Forty-four of the passengers, including four children, were Russian\ncitizens.[33][13] Thirty of them were tourists on a package tour from _Natalie\nTours_, one of the largest Russian tour operators.[11]\n\nAmong the passengers were Igor Pakus, chief physician of the Rostov Oblast\nregional clinic hospital and a member of the Regional Legislative Assembly,\nand Elvira Belyakova, head of Rostvertol's pension fund.[11]\n\n## Investigation[edit]\n\nOn the day of the crash, a commission was established by the Interstate\nAviation Committee to investigate the circumstances of and reasons for the\ncrash.[4] While being led by Russian air accident investigators, the\ncommission included representatives of the aviation authorities of the United\nArab Emirates (the state of the plane's registration and the aircraft\noperator), of the United States (where the aircraft was designed and\nproduced), and of France (where the plane's engines were designed).[4] The US\nteam in the commission consists of air accident investigators from NTSB,\nexperts from Boeing, and representatives from the FAA.[34]\n\nThe Russian Investigative Committee also opened a criminal investigation into\nany possible safety violations leading to the fatal crash,[35] and allocated\nmore than fifty investigators to work on the case.[19] In a statement, it\nlisted \"crew error, technical failure, adverse weather conditions and other\nfactors\" as possible reasons for the crash.[19] Terrorism was ruled out\nearlier as the cause of the crash.[7]\n\nOn 20 March the air crash investigation commission completed the field survey\nof the crash site and soon will finish the collection of the aircraft's\ndebris.[36] Russian and Emirati experts are analyzing radar data, ATC-crew\ncommunications and meteorological information.[36] Both flight recorders were\nrecovered from the crash site and delivered to the Interstate Aviation\nCommittee in Moscow.[4]\n\nAlso on 20 March, Russian air crash investigators, together with their\ncolleagues from the UAE and France, extracted the memory modules from the\nprotective casing and downloaded the data from the the flight data recorder\n(FDR).[36] According to preliminary analysis, FDR functioned normally during\nthe flight and kept recording the flight data until the aircraft's collision\nwith the ground.[36] The recording quality was good and experts begun to\ndecipher and analyze the recovered information.[36]\n\nThe cockpit voice recorder (CVR) was significantly damaged in the crash and\nits data cable was destroyed.[36] Experts have conducted an X-ray examination\nof the memory modules and the connection cable.[36] They will continue their\nefforts in restoring the CVR cable and checking the condition of its protected\nnon-volatile memory module.[36]\n\n## Reaction[edit]\n\nIn light of the disaster, the Governor of Rostov Oblast, Vasily Golubev,\nannounced that the government would pay 1 million rubles (about $15,000 USD)\nto the families of the victims.[7] The day after the crash has been designated\nas a day of mourning in the region.[7]\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n  1. **^** FZ is the IATA designator and FDB is the ICAO airline designator. These codes are commonly used in flight numbers, eg. _Flight FZ981_.\n  2. **^** The aircraft was a Boeing 737-800 model; Boeing assigns a unique customer code for each company that buys one of its aircraft, which is applied as an infix in the model number at the time the aircraft is built. The code for Flydubai is \"KN\", hence \"737-8KN\".\n  3. **^** Aircraft altitude is measured by air pressure according to calculated sea level taking into account the actual pressure, which declines as altitude above sea level increases. A flight level is the pressure altitude in hundreds of feet related to standard pressure of 1013,25 Hpa at sea level.\n  4. **^** Skydubai is the airline's assigned call sign.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. **^** \"Rostov-On-Don Airport in Russia\". _Sputnik News_. 19 March 2016.

He is an alleged terrorist accused of crimes of terrorism in France. According to police and governmental authorities, he was personally involved in the attacks in Paris on 13 November 2015 by providing logistical support for the assailants, having driven them to their target locations, and having had some involvement in the manufacture of explosives for use in acts of terrorism. In the Paris attacks, 130 people were killed and 368 others were injured.\n\nSoon after the details of the attacks became public, he was billed by some\nnewspapers as Public Enemy No. 1, or as \"the most wanted\" for crimes by the\nauthorities in Europe. Having evaded authorities, he became \"the target of one\nof the largest manhunts in modern European history\". Europol had Abdeslam as\nfirst in a list of wanted criminal out of 57 individuals listed publicly by\nthe organisation in January 2016.[2]\n\nAbdeslam is known to have had contacts or social links to the Islamic State of\nIraq and the Levant, since the ISIL organization subsequently made a claim of\nresponsibility for the attack. Of the men known to be involved in the attacks,\nhe and Mohammad Abrini are the only two still alive, due to the others\ninvolved either having killed themselves, or having been killed by police.[3]\n\nAfter four months on the run, Abdeslam was arrested during an anti-terrorist\nraid in the Molenbeek area of Brussels, on 18 March 2016, during which he was\ninjured.\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Personal background\n  * 2 Preceding the attacks\n  * 3 Involvement in Paris attacks\n  * 4 Escape\n  * 5 Manhunt\n  * 6 Capture\n  * 7 References\n  * 8 External links\n\n## Personal background[edit]\n\nSalah Abdeslam was born on 15 September 1989 in Brussels, Belgium. His parents\nare immigrants who were living in Bouyafar, a small village in northern\nMorocco, prior to emigration.[4] Though the Abdeslams lived in Belgium from\nthe 1960s, they were all French nationals, having acquired French nationality\nfrom the time the parents lived in Algeria.[1]\n\nAbdeslam and Abdelhamid Abaaoud were friends as children, when both were\nliving in Sint-Jans-Molenbeek.[5] Another childhood friend stated that\nAbdelsam liked football and motorbikes.[6] According to a woman to whom\nAbdeslam was briefly engaged in 2011, he and Abaaoud continued to be close\nfriends into adulthood.[7]\n\nAt some point, Abdeslam became a reputed user of cannabis. He also regularly\ndrank alcohol, was known to frequent gay bars where he associated himself with\ncircles of male homosexual prostitutes and their clients, and was regarded as\na \"rent boy\" by patrons and staff as he was \"always hanging out with that\nkinda crowd\".[8][9][10]\n\nAbdeslam was employed by STIB-MIVB as a mechanic from September 2009 to\n2011.[5][11] One source states his employment was terminated due to his\nrepeated absences,[12][13] but another source previously close to Abdeslam\nstated that his employment was terminated due to some kind of act or acts of\ncrime, for which he was subsequently sentenced to one month in jail.[7]\n\nFrom December 2013, Abdeslam was the manager of a bar named Les B\u00e9guines in\nMolenbeek, located west of Brussels, after his brother Brahim took over the\nlicense. Most of the bar's customers were of Maghrebian origin. The bar was\nclosed when authorities discovered that hallucinogenic substances were being\nused there.[11] Abdeslam and his brother sold the bar about six weeks before\nthe attacks.[14]\n\nAccording to one source, Abdeslam was already known to police authorities as a\nperson involved in petty crime.[15][16] Another states that both he and\nAbaaoud were imprisoned for armed robbery in 2010.[5] According to the lawyer\nrepresenting Abaaoud, his client and Abdeslam were arrested in December 2010\nfor attempting to break into a parking garage.[17] In February 2011, Abdeslam\nwas convicted for breaking and entering.[18] In February 2015, he was arrested\nby Dutch police and charged for possession of cannabis. He was subsequently\nfined \u20ac70.[19]\n\n## Preceding the attacks[edit]\n\nA woman Abdeslam was engaged to at the time of the attacks stated that he\nbecame radicalized from the influence of Abaaoud, after Abaaoud had returned\nfrom a period of terrorist activity in Syria sometime in 2014.[7] Sometime\nbefore the attacks, Abdeslam purchased twelve remote detonators and a number\nof batteries from a fireworks shop outside of Paris, as well as 15 litres of\nperoxide.[20][21]\n\nWithin the nine months preceding the attacks, Abdeslam was said to have\ntraveled to six countries,[22] including Germany and Austria, which he visited\nin October 2015, according to the German Minister of the Interior, Thomas de\nMaizi\u00e8re.[23] After his arrest and subsequent questioning, the French public\nprosecutor stated that Abdeslam was traveling throughout the countries as an\neffort to transport individuals, who would later be involved in the attacks,\ninto Europe.[24]\n\nAhmet Dahmani was with Abdeslam in August 2015, when the two travelled from\nItaly to Greece and back using a ferry service. Dahmani was arrested on 21\nNovember in Antalya, Turkey, as a member of an ISIL-affiliated Belgian-French\nnetwork.[25]\n\nAbdeslam was named on a list of people suspected of involvement in terrorist\nactivities, which was provided to the mayor of Molenbeek by the intelligence\nservices of Belgium on 26 October.[26] The mayor later stated that she did not\nuse the list to track down possible terrorists, adding that it was the\nresponsibility of the federal police.[27]\n\n_Le Point_ reported that Abdeslam used the website booking.com to rent rooms\n311 and 312 of the Apart'City hotel in Alfortville, two days prior to the\nattacks. Police found, among other things, syringes, pizza,[28] and chocolate\ncake[29] in the room. DNA traces indicated Abdeslam shared the room with\nothers.[28] According to another source, the rooms were apparently booked from\n11 November to 17 November.[30] A man named Mohamed Abrini was seen with\nAbdeslam on video footage recovered by police from 11 November. In the\nfootage, the two had stopped a black Renault Clio at a petrol station.[31][32]\nAbrini drove Abdeslam to Paris on 11 November.[33]\n\nStatements made to France 2 stated Salah Abdeslam and his brother Brahim were\narguing on the night of 12 November.[34]\n\n## Involvement in Paris attacks[edit]\n\nMain article: November 2015 Paris attacks\n\nAbdeslam was found to have been involved in assisting the attackers by hiring\ncars, flats, and hotel rooms.[35][36] An unconfirmed source, said to be an\nassociate of Abdeslam, testified that he heard Abdeslam claiming he had shot\npeople in Paris, while he and Abdeslam were driving away from the city after\nthe attacks.[37]\n\nAbdeslam rented a black Volkswagen Polo, which he used to drive the Bataclan\ntheatre attackers.[38] Both Salah and Brahim Abdeslam were traced to two\nvehicles, a SEAT and the Volkswagen rented by Salah.[39] Occupants of the car\nalso shot individuals at the Casa Nostra pizza restaurant and the La Belle\n\u00c9quipe cafe. Two male passengers, one of whom being Brahim Abdeslam, also\nkilled a number of people using machine guns while they were on terraces of\nbars in the 10th and 11th arrondissements of Paris. The SEAT Le\u00f3n model car\nwas later recovered,[15] and inside was found Kalashnikov automatic rifles and\nmagazines.[40][41] Another report stated that five full and eleven empty\nmagazines were found in the vehicle, along with fingerprint evidence.[40]\n\nLater, forensic analysis of a discarded suicide belt found at rue Frederic\nChopin in the Paris suburb of Montrouge found traces of sweat. The DNA on the\nsweat was matched to DNA samples held by police services for Abdeslam.[42] DNA\nreportedly found on the discarded belt was not matched to a sample of\nAbdeslam's DNA obtained by police.[43]\n\nAfter his arrest, Abdeslam confessed that he was also planning on being one of\nthe bombers at the Stade de France, but backed out at the last minute.[44]\n\n## Escape[edit]\n\nAbdeslam bought a SIM card at the Place Albert Kahn in the 18th arrondissement\nat about 22:00 hours.[45][46] He phoned a detainee at Namur prison[47] named\nAbdheila Chouaa, who was closely acquainted with Mohamed Abrini.[33] Abdeslam\nthen made a phone call to associates in Brussels, requesting they drive to him\nin order to help him escape. He was heard crying at the time of the\ncall.[15][48][49] He wandered the streets for a period of approximately\nseven[15] to nine hours until was collected at approximately 07:00 hours.[45]\nA data trace of the aforementioned call shows Abdeslam was in Montrouge at the\ntime,[34] and that the call was received by a cell site in Ch\u00e2tillon,[50]\nlikely either Ch\u00e2tillon-la-Borde or Ch\u00e2tillon, Hauts-de-Seine.[51][52]\n\nSalah phoned a person named Hamza Attou, begging for assistance.[53] He was\nsubsequently collected while he was near the Boulevard Barb\u00e8s in the 18th\narrondissement of Paris;[51][52] Hamza Attou and Mohammed Amri were\nsubsequently arrested because they drove Abdeslam after the shootings, and\nwere charged with participating in a terrorist act by the Belgian\nauthorities.[54] Attou later stated Abdeslam was crying at the time of the\ncall.[53]\n\nThe vehicle carrying Abdeslam, Attou, and Amri[37] was stopped by officers at\nCambrai en route to Belgium, but allowed to continue[39][55] because there was\nno evidence of Abdeslam's involvement in the attacks at the time.[56]\nAccording to Belgian Interior Minister Jan Jambon, a database at the police\ncheckpoint began showing details on Abdeslam fifteen minutes after his\ndeparture from the checkpoint.[57] The officers at the checkpoint were also\ndistracted by the smell of marijuana, which had earlier been smoked by Attou\nand Amri.[37]\n\nAbdeslam was believed to have briefly stayed at the flat of Ayoub Bazarouj at\nsome point after arriving in Belgium. Bazarouj was arrested on 16 November and\nhis flat was searched; the search recovered ten mobile phones.[58]\n\nAli Oulkadi, who was detained by Brussels police, provided assistance to\nAbdeslam by driving him to another part of Brussels on 14 November. Oulkadi\nclaimed he received a phone call from someone requesting him to drive someone\nto an unspecified location. He stated he was unaware at the time the person\nwas Abdeslam. Oulkadi drove to Laeken, where he found Abdeslam and the caller.\nOulkadi and Abdeslam went to a caf\u00e9 where a brief verbal exchange ensued on\nthe events of Paris. Afterwards, Abdeslam was given directions to\nSchaerbeek.[59]\n\n## Manhunt[edit]\n\nFrench and Belgian authorities released Abdeslam's photo and name on 15\nNovember 2015.[59] Abdeslam's brother Mohammed gave a televised message to his\nbrother, urging him to turn himself in if he was involved in the attacks.[60]\n\nOn 9 or 10 December, police entered an apartment at 86 Rue Berge in the\nSchaerbeek district[61][62] of Brussels, which had been rented under a false\nname.[63] Police found, among other things, a fingerprint belonging to\nAbdeslam, traces of an explosive known as TATP, and three handmade belts.[62]\nAbdeslam journeyed to the Henri Berg\u00e9 flat on 14 November, and later departed\napparently after two searches were made by police within the area on 4\nDecember.[64]\n\nAt 10:00 on 16 December, Belgian police entered a location where Abdeslam was\nbelieved to have been hiding. It was reported that the authorities were unable\nto enter the location during the previous day because of a Belgian law that\nprohibited officers from forcibly entering a home between the hours of 21:00\nand 05:00, except for situations where services were acting to apprehend\ncriminals suspected of specific crimes. In addition, the authorities had to\nwait in order to eliminate the risk towards children at a school and 200\u2013300\nworshipers at a mosque, both close to the location.[65]\n\nNew images of Abdeslam were released by the French media on 11 January 2016.\nThe images were taken from a petrol station located at Trith-Saint-L\u00e9ger and\ndated to the morning after the attacks.[66][67]\n\nOn 25 January 2016, it was reported that ISIL videos released to the public\nshowed footage of nine persons involved in the attacks, all of whom are now\ndeceased. No footage of Abdeslam was featured.[68]\n\nA trace of DNA from Abdeslam was found in an apartment in Forest raided by\nBelgian police on 15 March 2016. Prosecutors confirmed the find to AFP after\nit was initially reported in Belgian media. RTBF stated that it was \"more than\nlikely\" that Abdeslam was one of two suspects who fled the apartment after the\nraid.[69] In addition, police found an automatic rifle, eleven rifle\nmagazines, and a book of Salafism.[70]\n\n## Capture[edit]\n\nSee also: 2016 Brussels police raids\n\nOn 18 March 2016, Abdeslam was arrested in an anti-terror police raid on a\nflat located at 79 Rue des Quatre Vents of Molenbeek in Brussels, close to the\nlocation of his childhood home.[45][71][72][73] The raid started at\napproximately 15:30 hours,[46] about an hour after Belgian prosecutors\nconfirmed that they had found Abdeslam's fingerprint in an apartment in the\nForest area of Brussels.[74] According to one source, he was captured at about\n18:00 hours.[75]\n\nDuring the raid, Abdeslam was shot through the leg while charging toward\npolice officers in an apparent attempt to commit suicide by cop.[75][76][77]\nHe was subsequently taken to Saint Peters Hospital in Brussels for\ntreatment.[78] After being moved to Brussels' police headquarters and\ncharged,[79] he was transferred to maximum security imprisonment in a Bruge\njail on the night of 19 March.[80] He had managed to evade capture for\napproximately 126 days.[78] Abdeslam was unarmed at the time of his\narrest.[77]\n\nSuspicion was apparently aroused to the location after a person in the flat\nmade an unusually large pizza order. When officers arrived at the scene, they\nfound the woman who made the food order with two other adults, children, and\nAbdeslam.[81]\n\nOne other suspect was killed and another injured during the raid.[82] Several\nother people were arrested, including the injured suspect and three of\nAbdeslam's relatives who were believed to be sheltering him.[83]\n\nAbdeslam is due to be extradited to France to be tried.[84] He will try to\nfight the extradition. A Belgian federal prosecutor charged Abdeslam with\n\"participation in terrorist murder and participation in the activities of a\nterrorist organization\".[85]\n\nOn 20 March, Abdeslam confessed to planning new operations in Brussels and\nhaving access to several heavy weapons.[77]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ _**a**_ _**b**_ Avi Davis (19 March 2016). \"Abdeslam: From petty crime to IS group terrorism\".

We will explain some of the DOs and DON'Ts, then show\nyou how to create an article. When you're ready to start writing, consider\nusing the Article Wizard to help you create the article\u2014it will walk you\nthrough these steps and help you understand the basics of creating a new\nwikipedia page .\n\n    _Keep in mind that if the article is not acceptable, it will be deleted quickly. Wikipedia has a new pages patrol division where people check new articles shortly after creation._\n\n  * **Articles that do not meet notability guidelines and do not cite reliable published sources are very likely to be deleted.**\n  * **Do not create**: pages about **yourself**, your **company**, your **band**, or your **friends**; pages that **advertise**; **personal essays**; or other articles you would not find in an encyclopedia.\n  * **Be careful** about the following: **copying things**, **controversial** material, extremely **short articles**, and **local-interest articles**.\n\nHere are some tips that can help you:\n\n  1. You can only create a new article directly once you've registered an account\u2014you need only choose a username and password. If you don't want to register for an account, registered and unregistered users alike may submit their article for review and publishing by others at the Articles for Creation project.\n  2. Wikipedia covers certain kinds of subjects and not others. Wikipedia requires that subjects for articles be \"worthy of notice\"; this concept of notability serves to avoid the indiscriminate inclusion of new topics. If the topic is likely to be suitable for an encyclopedia, go ahead; if you're unsure, or the article is about you or something you are closely connected to, you can ask questions at the Wikipedia Teahouse.\n  3. **Search Wikipedia first** in case an article _already exists_ on the subject, perhaps under a different title. If the article already exists, feel free to practice by making any constructive edits to improve it.\n  4. **Practice first.** Before starting, try editing existing articles to get a feel for writing and for using Wikipedia's mark-up language\u2014we recommend that you first take a tour through the Wikipedia tutorial or review contributing to Wikipedia to learn editing basics.\n  5. **Gather references** both to use as source(s) of the information you will include and to demonstrate the **notability** of your article's subject matter. Wikipedia requires the use of reliable published sources. Sources, particularly internet sources, should also be stable, meaning they should be high enough quality that they will continue to exist for future generations. There are many places to find reliable sources, including your local library, but if internet-based sources are to be used, start with books and news archive searches rather than a simple web search. Extra care should be taken to make sure that articles on **living persons** have reliable sources \u2013 articles about living people without reliable sources may be deleted, especially if they include negative or controversial content. References to blogs, personal websites, Facebook and YouTube are unsuitable and material obtained from them may be challenged and removed.\n  6. **Consider requesting feedback.** You can request feedback on articles you would like to create in a number of places, including the talk page of a related WikiProject or the Teahouse.\n  7. **Consider creating the article first in your user space.** As a registered user, you have your own user space. You can start the new article there, on a subpage; you can get it in shape, take your time, ask other editors to help work on it, and only move it into the \"live\" part of Wikipedia once it is ready to go. To create your own subpage, see here. When the new article is \"ready for prime time\", you can move it into the main article space. (Notes. The Article Wizard has an option to create these kinds of draft pages. Even in user space, unacceptable articles (see below) are liable to be nominated for deletion.)\n\n## Search for an existing article\n\nWikipedia already has 5,107,202 articles. Before creating an article, try to\nmake sure there is not already an article on the same topic, perhaps under a\nslightly different name. Search for the article, and review Wikipedia's\narticle titling policy before creating your first article. If an article on\nyour topic already exists, but you think people might look for it under some\ndifferent name or spelling, learn how to create _redirects_ to alternative\ntitles; adding needed redirects is a good way to help Wikipedia. Also,\nremember to check the article's deletion log in order to avoid creating an\narticle that has already been deleted. (In some cases, the topic may be\nsuitable even if deleted in the past; the past deletion may have been because\nit was a copyright violation, did not explain the importance of the topic, or\non other grounds addressed to the writing rather that the topic's\nsuitability.)\n\nIf a search does not find the topic, consider broadening your search to find\nexisting articles that might include the subject of your article. For example,\nif you want to write an article about a band member, you might search for the\nband and then add information about your subject as a section within that\nbroader article.\n\n## Gathering references\n\nNotability  \n---  \nSubject-specific guidelines  \n  \n  * Academics\n  * Astronomical objects\n  * Books\n  * Events\n  * Films\n  * Geographic features\n  * Music\n  * Numbers\n  * Organizations and companies\n  * People\n  * Sports and athletes\n  * Web content  \n  \nSee also  \n  \n  * Wikipedia essays\u00a0(by subject)\n  * Common deletion outcomes\n  * Why was the page I created deleted?  \n  \n  * v\n  * t\n  * e  \n  \nGather sources for the information you will be writing about. To be worthy of\ninclusion in an encyclopedia, a subject must be sufficiently notable, and that\nnotability must be verifiable through citations to reliable sources.\n\nAs noted, the sources you use must be _reliable_; that is, they must be\nsources that exercise some form of editorial control and have some reputation\nfor fact checking and accuracy. Print sources (and web-based versions of those\nsources) tend to be the most reliable, though some web-only sources may also\nbe reliable. Examples might include (but are not limited to) books published\nby major publishing houses, newspapers, magazines, peer-reviewed scholarly\njournals, websites of any of the above, and other websites that meet the same\nrequirements as a reputable print-based source.\n\nIn general, sources with **no** editorial control are not reliable. These\ninclude (but are not limited to) books published by vanity presses, self-\npublished 'zines', blogs, web forums, usenet discussions, personal social\nmedia, fan sites, vanity websites that permit the creation of self-promotional\narticles, and other similar venues. If anyone at all can post information\nwithout anyone else checking that information, it is probably not reliable.\n\nTo put it simply, if there are reliable sources (such as newspapers, journals,\nor books) with extensive information published over an extended period about a\nsubject, then that subject is notable and you must cite such sources as part\nof the process of creating (or expanding) the Wikipedia article. If you cannot\nfind such _reliable sources_ that provide extensive and comprehensive\ninformation about your proposed subject, then the subject is not notable or\nverifiable and almost certainly will be deleted. So your first job is to **go\nfind references** to cite.\n\nThere are many places to find reliable sources, including your local library,\nbut if internet-based sources are to be used, start with books and news\narchive searches rather than a web search.\n\nOnce you have references for your article, you can learn to place the\nreferences into the article by reading Wikipedia:Referencing for beginners and\nWikipedia:Citing sources. Do not worry too much about formatting citations\nproperly. It would be great if you did that, but the main thing is to **get\nreferences into the article**, even if they are not perfectly formatted.\n\n## Things to avoid\n\nMain pages: Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not and Wikipedia:Avoiding common\nmistakes\n\nArticles about yourself, your friends, your website, a band you're in, your\nteacher, a word you made up, or a story you wrote\n\n    If you _are_ worthy of inclusion in the encyclopedia, let someone else add an article for you. Putting your friends in an encyclopedia may seem like a nice surprise or an amusing joke, but articles like this are likely to be removed. In this process, feelings may be hurt and you may be blocked from editing if you repeatedly make attempts to re-create the article. These things can be avoided by a little forethought on your part. The article may remain if you have enough humility to make it neutral and you really are notable, but even then it's best to submit a draft for approval and consensus of the community instead of just posting it up, since unconscious biases may still exist of which you may not be aware.\nNon-notable topics\n\n    People frequently add pages to Wikipedia without considering whether the topic is really notable enough to go into an encyclopedia. Because Wikipedia does not have the space limitations of paper-based encyclopedias, our notability policies and guidelines allow a wide range of articles \u2013 however, they do not allow _every_ topic to be included. A particularly common special case of this is pages about people, companies, or groups of people, that do not substantiate the notability or importance of their subject with reliable sources, so we have decided that such pages may be speedily deleted under our WP:SPEEDY policy. This can offend \u2013 so _please_ consider whether your chosen topic is notable enough for Wikipedia, and then substantiate the notability or importance of your subject by citing those reliable sources in the process of creating your article. Wikipedia is not a directory of everything in existence.\nAdvertising\n\n    Please do not try to promote your product or business. Please do not insert external links to your commercial website unless a neutral party would judge that the link truly belongs in the article; we do have articles about products like Kleenex or Sharpies, or notable businesses such as McDonald's, but if you are writing about a product or business be sure you write from a neutral point of view, that you have no conflict of interest, and that you are able to find references in reliable sources that are independent from the subject you are writing about.\nPersonal essays or original research\n\n    Wikipedia surveys _existing_ human knowledge; it is not a place to publish new work. Do not write articles that present your own original theories, opinions, or insights, _even if_ you can support them by reference to accepted work. A common mistake is to present a novel synthesis of ideas in an article. Remember, just because both Fact A and Fact B are true does not mean that A caused B, or vice versa (fallacies). If the synthesis or causation is true, locate and cite reliable sources that report the connection.\nA single sentence or only a website link\n\n    Articles need to have real content of their own.\nAttacks on a person or organization\n\n    Material that violates our biographies of living persons policy or is intended to threaten, defame, or harass its subject or another entity is not permitted. Unsourced negative information, especially in articles about living people, is quickly removed, and attack pages may be deleted immediately.\n_See also:_\n\n  * List of bad article ideas\n\n## And be careful about...\n\nCopyright\n\nAs a general rule, **do not copy-paste text from other websites**. (There are\na few limited exceptions, and a few words as part of a properly cited and\nclearly attributed quotation is OK.)\n\n\u2013 _Wikipedia:Copy-paste_\n\nCopying things. Do not violate copyrights\n\n    Never copy and paste text into a Wikipedia article unless it is a relatively short quotation, placed in quotation marks, and cited using an inline citation. Even material that you are _sure_ is in the public domain must be attributed to the source, or the result, while not a copyright violation, is plagiarism. Also note that most web pages **are not** in the public domain and most song lyrics **are not** either. In fact, most things published after 1923, and almost everything written since January 1, 1978 are automatically under copyright _even if they have no copyright notice or \u00a9 symbol._ If you think what you are contributing is in the public domain, _say where you got it,_ either in the article or on the discussion page, and on the discussion page give the reason why you think it is in the public domain (e.g. \"It was published in 1895...\"). For more information, see Wikipedia:Copyrights (which includes instructions for verifying permission to copy previously published text) and our non-free content guidelines for text. Finally, please note that superficial modification of material, such as minor rewording, is insufficient to avoid plagiarism and copyright violations. See Wikipedia:Close paraphrasing.\n\nGood sources\n\n1\\. have a reputation for reliability: they are reliable sources  \n2\\. are independent of the subject  \n3\\. are verifiable by other editors\n\nGood research and citing your sources\n\n    Articles written out of thin air may be better than nothing, but they are hard to verify, which is an important part of building a trusted reference work. Please research with the best sources available and cite them properly. Doing this, along with not copying text, will help avoid any possibility of plagiarism. We welcome _good_ short articles, called \"stubs\", that can serve as launching pads from which others can take off \u2013 stubs can be relatively short, a few sentences, but should provide some useful information. If you do not have enough material to write a good stub, you probably should not create an article. At the end of a stub, you should include a \"stub template\" like this: {{stub}}. (Other Wikipedians will appreciate it if you use a more specific stub template, like {{art-stub}}. See the list of stub types for a list of all specific stub templates.) Stubs help track articles that need expansion.\n\nArticles about living persons\n\n    Articles written about living persons must be referenced so that they can be verified. Biographies about living subjects that lack sources may be deleted.\n\nAdvocacy and controversial material\n\n    Please do not write articles that advocate one particular viewpoint on politics, religion, or anything else. Understand what we mean by a neutral point of view before tackling this sort of topic.\n\nArticles that contain different definitions of the topic\n\n    Articles are primarily about what something **is**, _not_ any term(s). If the article is just about a word or phrase and especially if there are very different ways that a term is used, it usually belongs in Wiktionary. Instead, try to write a good short first paragraph that defines one _subject_ as well as some more material to go with it.\n\nOrganization\n\n    Make sure there are incoming links to the new article from other Wikipedia articles (click \"What links here\" in the toolbox) and that the new article is included in at least one appropriate category (see help:category). Otherwise it will be difficult for readers to find the article.\n\nLocal-interest articles\n\n    These are articles about places like schools, or streets that are of interest to a relatively small number of people such as alumni or people who live nearby. _There is no consensus_ about such articles, but some will challenge them if they include nothing that shows how the place is special and different from tens of thousands of similar places. Photographs add interest. Try to give local-interest articles local colour. Third-party sources are the only way to prove that the subject you are writing about is notable.\n\nBreaking news events\n\n    While Wikipedia accepts articles about notable recent events, articles about breaking news events with no enduring notability are not appropriate for our project. Consider writing such articles on our sister project Wikinews. See Wikipedia:Notability (events) for further information.\n\nEditing on the wrong page\n\n    If you're trying to create a new page, you'll start with a completely empty edit box. If you see text in the editing box that is filled with words you didn't write (for example, the contents of this page), you're accidentally editing a pre-existing page. Don't save your changes. See #How to create a page below, and start over.\n\n## Are you closely connected to the article topic?\n\nWikipedia is the encyclopedia that anyone can edit, but there are special\nguidelines for editors who are paid or sponsored. These guidelines are\nintended to prevent biased articles, and maintain the public's trust that\ncontent in Wikipedia is impartial and has been added in good faith. (See\nWikipedia's conflict of interest (COI) guideline.)\n\nThe official guidelines are that editors **must be volunteers.** That means\nWikipedia discourages editing articles about individuals, companies,\norganizations, products/services, or political causes that pay you directly or\nindirectly. This includes in-house PR departments and marketing departments,\nother company employees, public relations firms and publicists, social media\nconsultants, and online reputation management consultants. However, Wikipedia\nrecognizes the large volume of good faith contributions by people who have\nsome affiliation to the articles they work on.\n\nHere are some ground rules. If you break these rules, your edits are likely to\nbe reverted, and the article(s) and your other edits may get extra scrutiny\nfrom other Wikipedia editors. Your account may also be blocked.\n\nThings to avoid | Things to be careful about | Great ways to contribute  \n---|---|---  \n  \n  * Don't add promotional language\n  * Don't remove negative/critical text from an article\n  * Don't make a \"group\" account for multiple people to share\n  * Don't neglect to disclose your affiliation on the article's talk page\n|\n\n  * Maintain a neutral, objective tone in any content you add or edit\n  * Cite secondary sources (e.g., a major media article) for any new statements you add \u2013 even if you are confident a statement is true (e.g., it is about your work), only say it if it has been restated already in a secondary source.\n|\n\n  * Make minor edits/corrections to articles (e.g., typos, fixing links, adding references to new secondary sources)\n  * If you are biased, suggest new article text or edits on the _article talk page_ (not on the main article page).\n  * Disclose your relationship to the client/topic.\n  * Edit using personal accounts.\n  * Recruit help: Seek out a sponsor (volunteer editor) who has worked on similar articles, or submit ideas for article topics via Requested articles.  \n  \nNote that this has to do only with conflict of interest. Editors are\nencouraged to write on topics related to their expertise: e.g., a NASA\nstaffperson might write about planets, or an academic researcher might write\nabout their field. Also, Wikipedians-in-residence or other interns who are\npaid, hosted or otherwise sponsored by a scientific or cultural institution\ncan upload content and write articles in partnership with curators, indirectly\nproviding positive branding for their hosts.\n\n## How to create a page\n\nFor a technical guide to the mechanics of page creation, see Wikipedia:How to\ncreate a page.\n\nOnly logged in users can create an article. If you have written an article but\nhave no account you can submit your article for review and publishing at\nArticles for Creation.\n\n### Title for your new article\n\nIn the search box below, type the title of your article, then click Go. If the\nSearch page reports \"You may create the page\" followed by the article name in\nred, then you can click the red article name to start editing your article.\n\n_**Is it new?**_  \nType, then click \"Go (try title)\" |\n\n  \n  \n  \n---|---  \n  \nThere may or may not be an article with the same title as the one you wish to\ncreate.\n\nIf there is no article with the exact title, this does not necessarily mean\nsuch an article does not exist. As mentioned above, a search can help reveal\nthis.\n\n#### Resolving clashes\n\nMain page: Wikipedia:Disambiguation\n\nSometimes there is already an article under your chosen title, but on a\ndifferent topic. In this case, the titles must be distinguished from one\nanother. The process of distinguishing identical or similar titles with\ndistinct meanings is called \"disambiguation\". This can be confusing for\nnewcomers: if necessary, create your page as a userspace draft, then ask at\nthe new contributors' help page or help desk for help on sorting out the\ndisambiguation.\n\nThere are three main ways disambiguation is done, depending on how many topics\nthere are and whether there's one which is much more important than the rest:\n\n  * **Disambiguation page**. For example, when you enter the word _\"Salsa\"_, you will be brought to a page known as a disambiguation page that will list all the subjects named _\"Salsa\"_, including Salsa (sauce), Salsa music, and several other meanings of the word Salsa. Please only create disambiguation pages for existing article clashes, not for prospective articles.\n  * **Primary usage**. In some cases, the title by itself will be used for the most common meaning of the term (the \"primary usage\"), and all other uses will be found on a disambiguation page. For example, when you enter Mouse, you will be brought to the article about the animal. All other uses, such as Mouse (computing), are listed on the disambiguation page.\n  * **Just two topics**. Or in some cases, if there are only two meanings of a title, the plain title will be used for one meaning (the more common one), and a message on the top of that page, known as a hatnote, will be used to direct readers to the other. For example, if you enter Avocado, you will be brought to the article about the plant. A hatnote will direct you to a town called Avocado, California.\n\n### Entering references\n\nThe very first thing you should write in your article is a list of the\nsource(s) for your information. For now, just enter them like this (and they\nwill automatically turn into links):\n\n    (1) http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/12/books/12vonnegut.html\n    (2) http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/space/space_shuttle.html\n\nLater, you'll learn how to format them to appear as footnotes.\n\nIf you know that it will take you a few edits to list references properly, put\nthe template **`{{newpage}}`** on top of the page to signify to other editors\nthat you are working on it. Even better is to create your article in a subpage\nof your user page, take as long as you need to make it a good article, then\nmove it to the main article space. You can create your personal sandbox for\narticle development by clicking this link. However, even in user space\narticles on unacceptable topics are liable to be nominated for deletion.\n\n### Categorizing\n\nEvery article should be in one or more Wikipedia categories. Often the easiest\nway to find relevant categories is to think of a similar topic that has an\narticle and visit it to see the categories it is placed in. Otherwise, you may\ngo to Category:Articles and click on any relevant subcategories, then keep\nfollowing relevant subcategory links as far as you can. Follow all relevant\nsubcategory chains, and add a category declaration, written [[Category:your\ncategory]], at the bottom of your article for each relevant category that has\nno relevant subcategories of its own.\n\n### Final step\n\nAfter you have entered your article, click Show preview to check for errors,\nthen click Save page.\n\n## And then what?\n\nNow that you have created the page, there are still several things you can do.\n\n### Keep making improvements\n\nWikipedia is not finished. Generally, an article is nowhere near being\ncompleted the moment it is created. There is a long way to go. In fact, it may\ntake you several edits just to get it started.\n\nIf you have so much interest in the article you just created, you may learn\nmore about it in the future, and accordingly have more to add. This may be\nlater today, tomorrow, or several months from now. Any time \u2013 go ahead.\n\n### Improve formatting\n\nTo format your article correctly (and expand it, and possibly even make it\nfeatured!), see\n\n  * Wikipedia:Tutorial to learn how to format your article\n  * Wikipedia:Writing better articles\n  * Wikipedia:The perfect article\n  * Wikipedia:Lead section\n\nOthers can freely contribute to the article when it has been saved. The\ncreator does not have special rights to control the later content. See\nWikipedia:Ownership of articles.\n\nAlso, before you get frustrated or offended about the way others modify or\nremove your contributions, see Wikipedia:Don't be ashamed.\n\n### Avoid orphans\n\nAn orphaned article is an article that has few or no other articles linking to\nit. The main problem with an orphan is that it'll be unknown to others, and\nmay get fewer readers if it is not de-orphaned.\n\nMost new articles are orphans from the moment they are created, but you can\nwork to change that. This will involve editing one or more _other_ articles.\nTry searching Wikipedia for other pages referring to the subject of your\narticle, then turn those references into links by adding double brackets to\neither side: \"[[\" and \"]]\". If another article has a word or phrase that has\nthe same meaning as your new article, but not expressed in the same words as\nthe title, you can link that word or phrase as follows: \"[[title of your new\narticle|word or phrase found in other article]].\" Or in certain cases, you\ncould create that word or phrase as a redirect to your new article.\n\nOne of the first things you want to do after creating a new article is to\nprovide links to it so it will not be an orphan. You can do that right away,\nor if you find that exhausting, you can wait a while, provided that you keep\nthe task in mind.\n\nSee Wikipedia:Drawing attention to new pages to learn how to get others to see\nyour new articles.\n\n### Add to a disambiguation page\n\nIf the term is ambiguous (meaning there are multiple pages using that or a\nsimilar title), see if there is a disambiguation page for articles bearing\nthat title. If so, add it to that page.\n\n## Still need help?\n\n  * For a list of informative, instructional and supportive pages, see Help directory.\n  * The best places to ask for assistance is at the Teahouse and at the main Help desk.\n  * Click here to ask for help on your talk page, a volunteer will visit you there shortly!\n  * For a list of the services and assistance that can be requested on Wikipedia, see Request departments.\n  * Alternately you can ask a question through the Wikipedia help channel on IRC chat.\n\n### Read a traditional encyclopedia\n\nTry to read traditional paper encyclopedia articles to get the layout, style,\ntone, and other elements of encyclopedic content. It is suggested that if you\nplan to write articles for an encyclopedia, you have some background knowledge\nin formal writing as well as about the topic at hand. A composition class in\nyour high school or college is recommended before you start writing\nencyclopedia articles.\n\nThe World Book is a good place to start. The goal of Wikipedia is to create an\nup-to-the-moment encyclopedia on every notable subject imaginable. Pretend\nthat your article will be published in a paper encyclopedia.\n\n* * *\n\n|\n\n  * v\n  * t\n  * e\n\nWikipedia help pages  \n  \n---  \n  \n  * **Noticeboards**\u00a0(?)\n  * **FAQs**\u00a0(?)\n  * **Reference desks**\u00a0(?)\n  * _**The Missing Manual**_\u00a0(?)  \n  \nAbout Wikipedia |\n\n  * Principles\u00a0(Wikipedia in brief)\n  * Policies and guidelines\n  * What Wikipedia is not\n  * Disclaimer\u00a0(parental advice)\n  * Making requests\n    * where to ask questions\n    * contact Wikipedia directly\n  * Who writes Wikipedia?\n  * Why create an account?  \n  \nHelp for readers |\n\n  * FAQ\n  * Books\n  * Copyright\n  * Glossary\n  * Mobile access\n  * Navigation\n  * Other languages\n  * Searching\n  * Students\n  * Viewing media  \n  \nContributing  \nto Wikipedia |\n\n  * A plain and simple overview\n  * A primer for newcomers\n  * Asking for help\n  * Advice for young editors\n  * Avoiding common mistakes\n  * Etiquette\u00a0(community expectations)\n  * Learning the ropes\n  * Instructional material\n  * Simplified Manual of Style\n  * Simplified rule-set\n    * \"Ignore all rules\"\n    * \"The rules are principles\"\n  * Style-tips\n  * Tip of the day\n  * Job Center\n  * **Your first article**\u00a0(article wizard)\n  * Vandalism  \n  \nGetting started |\n\n  * Wikipedia intro\n  * Wikipedia tutorial\n  * The Wikipedia Adventure\n  * Newcomers' training\n  * New contributors' help page\n  * Manual of Style intro\n  * Graphics tutorials\n  * Picture tutorial (Uploading intro)\n  * IRC (live chat) tutorial\n  * Navigating intro\n  * Policies intro\n  * Referencing intro\n  * Tables intro\n  * Talk pages intro\n  * VisualEditor user guide  \n  \nHow-to pages and  \ninformation pages |\n\n  * Appealing blocks\n  * Article deletion\n  * Categories\n  * Citations\u00a0/ references\n    * Referencing for beginners\n    * Citation Style 1\n    * Cite errors\n    * References and page numbers\n  * Diff\n  * Editing\n    * toolbar\n    * edit conflict\n  * Email confirmation\n  * Find sources\n  * Files\n  * Footnotes\n  * Image deletion\n  * Infoboxes\n  * Linking\u00a0(link color)\n  * Logging in\n  * Merging\n  * Namespaces\n  * Page name\n  * Redirect\n  * Renaming pages\n  * Passwords\n  * Reverting\n  * Talk pages\u00a0(archiving)\n  * URL\n  * User contributions\n  * User page design center  \n  \nCoding wiki markup |\n\n  * Wiki markup\u00a0(cheatsheet)\n  * Barcharts\n  * Calculations\n  * Characters\n  * Citation templates\n  * Columns\n  * HTML\n  * Lists\n  * Magic words\u00a0(introduction)\n  * Music symbols\n  * Sections\n  * Sounds\n  * Tables\u00a0(introduction)\n  * Templates\n    * documentation\n    * messages\n  * Transclusion\n  * Visual files\n  * Wiki tools  \n  \nDirectories |\n\n  * Abbreviations\n  * Departments\n  * Editor's index\n  * Essays\n  * FAQs\n  * Glossary\n  * Guidelines\n  * Help menu\n  * Manual of Style\n  * Policies\n  * Shortcuts\n  * Tips  \n  \nVisit the **Teahouse** if you are a new editor looking for interactive help,\nor the **Help desk** for an interactive Q &amp; A forum  \n![Question](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e0/Symbol_question.svg\n/16px-Symbol_question.svg.png)\u00a0**Ask for help on your talk page**  \n  \n![Question book magnify2.svg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a\n/ab/Question_book_magnify2.svg/30px-Question_book_magnify2.svg.png)\n\n![](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1)\n\n  *[Q &amp; A]: questions and answers\n  *[(?)]: A how-to guide that explains the process of contributing to the English Wikipedia, both for novice users and experienced editors.\n  *[e]: Edit this template\n  *[t]: Discuss this template\n  *[v]: View this template\n\n", "title": ["Wikipedia:Your first article"], "summary": "<p><b>Welcome to Wikipedia!</b></p>"},

Istanbul is a transcontinental city in Eurasia, straddling the Bosphorus strait between the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea. Its commercial and historical center lies on the European side and about a third of its population lives on the Asian side.[10] The city is the administrative center of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (coterminous with Istanbul Province), both hosting a population of around 14 million residents.[4] Istanbul is one of the world's most populous cities and ranks as world's 6th-largest city proper and the largest European city.\n\nFounded under the name of _Byzantium_ on the Sarayburnu promontory around 660\nBCE, the city developed to become one of the most significant in history.\nAfter its reestablishment as _Constantinople_ in 330 CE, it served as an\nimperial capital for almost 16 centuries, during the Roman and Byzantine\n(330\u20131204 and 1261\u20131453), the Latin (1204\u20131261), and the Ottoman (1453\u20131922)\nempires.[11] It was instrumental in the advancement of Christianity during\nRoman and Byzantine times, before the Ottomans conquered the city in 1453 and\ntransformed it into an Islamic stronghold and the seat of the Ottoman\nCaliphate.[12]\n\nIstanbul's strategic position on the historic Silk Road,[13] rail networks to\nEurope and the Middle East, and the only sea route between the Black Sea and\nthe Mediterranean have produced a cosmopolitan populace, although less so\nsince the establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923. Overlooked for the\nnew capital during the interwar period, the city has since regained much of\nits prominence. The population of the city has increased tenfold since the\n1950s, as migrants from across Anatolia have moved in and city limits have\nexpanded to accommodate them.[14][15] Arts, Music, Film and Cultural festivals\nwere established at the end of the 20th century and continue to be hosted by\nthe city today, and infrastructure improvements have produced a complex\ntransportation network.\n\nApproximately 12.56 million foreign visitors arrived in Istanbul in 2015, five\nyears after it was named a European Capital of Culture, making the city the\nworld's fifth most popular tourist destination.[16] The city's biggest\nattraction is its historic center, partially listed as a UNESCO World Heritage\nSite, and its cultural and entertainment hub can be found across the city's\nnatural harbor, the Golden Horn, in the Beyo\u011flu district. Considered a global\ncity,[17] Istanbul has one of the fastest-growing metropolitan economies in\nthe world.[18] It hosts the headquarters of many Turkish companies and media\noutlets and accounts for more than a quarter of the country's gross domestic\nproduct.[19] Hoping to capitalize on its revitalization and rapid expansion,\nIstanbul bid for the Summer Olympics five times in twenty years.[20]\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Toponymy\n  * 2 History\n    * 2.1 Rise and fall of Constantinople\n    * 2.2 Ottoman and Turkish era\n  * 3 Geography\n    * 3.1 Climate\n  * 4 Cityscape\n    * 4.1 Architecture\n  * 5 Administration\n  * 6 Demographics\n    * 6.1 Religious and ethnic groups\n  * 7 Politics\n  * 8 Economy\n  * 9 Culture\n    * 9.1 Leisure and entertainment\n  * 10 Sports\n  * 11 Media\n  * 12 Education\n  * 13 Public services\n  * 14 Transportation\n  * 15 Sister and twin cities\n  * 16 See also\n  * 17 Notes\n  * 18 References\n    * 18.1 Bibliography\n  * 19 External links\n\n## Toponymy[edit]\n\nMain article: Names of Istanbul\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Rome-Capitole-\nStatueConstantin.jpg/170px-Rome-Capitole-StatueConstantin.jpg)\n\nConstantine I\n\nThe first known name of the city is _Byzantium_ (Greek: \u0392\u03c5\u03b6\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd,\n_Byz\u00e1ntion_), the name given to it at its foundation by Megarean colonists\naround 660 BCE.[1] The name is thought to be derived from a personal name,\nByzas. Ancient Greek tradition refers to a legendary king of that name as the\nleader of the Greek colonists. Modern scholars have also hypothesized that the\nname of Byzas was of local Thracian or Illyrian origin and hence predated the\nMegarean settlement.[21]\n\nAfter Constantine the Great made it the new eastern capital of the Roman\nEmpire in 330 CE, the city became widely known as \"Constantinopolis\"\n(Constantinople), which, as the Latinized form of \"\u039a\u03c9\u03bd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03cd\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2\"\n(_Konstantino\u00fapolis_), means the \"City of Constantine\".[1] He also attempted\nto promote the name \"Nova Roma\" and its Greek version \"\u039d\u03ad\u03b1 \u1fec\u03ce\u03bc\u03b7\" _Nea Rom\u0113_\n(New Rome), but this did not enter widespread usage.[22] _Constantinople_\nremained the most common name for the city in the West until the establishment\nof the Turkish Republic, and _Kostantiniyye_ (Ottoman Turkish \u0642\u0633\u0637\u0646\u0637\u064a\u0646\u064a\u0647) and\n_\u0130stanbul_ were the names used alternatively by the Ottomans during their\nrule.[23] The use of _Constantinople_ to refer to the city during the Ottoman\nperiod (from the mid-15th century) is now considered politically incorrect,\neven if not historically inaccurate, by Turks.[24]\n\nBy the 19th century, the city had acquired other names used by either\nforeigners or Turks. Europeans used _Constantinople_ to refer to the whole of\nthe city, but used the name _Stamboul_\u2014as the Turks also did\u2014to describe the\nwalled peninsula between the Golden Horn and the Sea of Marmara.[24] _Pera_\n(from the Greek word for \"across\") was used to describe the area between the\nGolden Horn and the Bosphorus, but Turks also used the name _Beyo\u011flu_ (today\nthe official name for one of the city's constituent districts).[25] _Islambol_\n(meaning either \"City of Islam\" or \"Full of Islam\") was sometimes colloquially\nused to refer to the city, and was even engraved on some Ottoman coins,[26]\nbut the belief that it was the precursor to the present name, _\u0130stanbul_, is\nbelied by the fact that the latter existed well before the former and even\npredates the Ottoman conquest of the city.[1]\n\nThe name _\u0130stanbul_ (Turkish pronunciation:\u00a0[is\u02c8tanbu\u026b]\n(![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg\n/13px-Speaker_Icon.svg.png) listen), colloquially [\u026fs\u02c8tambu\u026b]) is commonly\nheld to derive from the Medieval Greek phrase \"\u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03a0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd\" (pronounced [is\ntim \u02c8bolin]), which means \"to the city\"[27] and is how Constantinople was\nreferred to by the local Greeks. This reflected its status as the only major\ncity in the vicinity. The importance of Constantinople in the Ottoman world\nwas also reflected by its Ottoman name 'Der Saadet' meaning the 'gate to\nProsperity' in Ottoman. An alternative view is that the name evolved directly\nfrom the name _Constantinople_, with the first and third syllables dropped.[1]\nA Turkish folk etymology traces the name to Islam bol \"plenty of Islam\"[28]\nbecause the city was called _Islambol_ (\"plenty of Islam\") or _Islambul_\n(\"find Islam\") as the capital of the Islamic Ottoman Empire. It is first\nattested shortly after the conquest, and its invention was ascribed by some\ncontemporary writers to Sultan Mehmed II himself.[29] Some Ottoman sources of\nthe 17th century, such as Evliya \u00c7elebi, describe it as the common Turkish\nname of the time; between the late 17th and late 18th centuries, it was also\nin official use. The first use of the word \"Islambol\" on coinage was in 1703\n(1115 AH) during the reign of Sultan Ahmed III. Nevertheless, the use of the\nname _Constantinople_ remained common in English into the 20th century,\n_Istanbul_ became common only after Turkey adapted the Latin alphabet in 1928\nand urged other countries to use the city's Turkish name.[30][31] The Vikings\nwere sailing down the Russian rivers from the North Sea, entering the Black\nSea and arriving in Constantinople around the 10th century. They used to call\nConstantinople \"Miklagard\"[32] meaning the \"Big City\".\n\nIn modern Turkish, the name is written as _\u0130stanbul_, with a dotted \u0130, as the\nTurkish alphabet distinguishes between a dotted and dotless I. In English the\nstress is on the first syllable (_Is_), but in Turkish it is on the second\nsyllable (_tan_).[33] A person from the city is an _\u0130stanbullu_ (plural:\n_\u0130stanbullular_), although _Istanbulite_ is used in English.[34]\n\n## History[edit]\n\nMain article: History of Istanbul\n\nSee also: Timeline of Istanbul history\n\n![A stout cylindrical column in a courtyard in front of palatial arches of\nIslamic style](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Second_Cour\nt_Topkapi_2007_80.JPG/220px-Second_Court_Topkapi_2007_80.JPG)\n\nRemains of a Byzantine column found at Byzantium's acropolis, located today\nwithin the Topkap\u0131 Palace complex\n\nNeolithic artifacts, uncovered by archeologists at the beginning of the 21st\ncentury, indicate that Istanbul's historic peninsula was settled as far back\nas the 7th millennium BCE.[35] That early settlement, important in the spread\nof the Neolithic Revolution from the Near East to Europe, lasted for almost a\nmillennium before being inundated by rising water levels.[36][37][38][39] The\nfirst human settlement on the Asian side, the Fikirtepe mound, is from the\nCopper Age period, with artifacts dating from 5500 to 3500 BCE,[40] On the\nEuropean side, near the point of the peninsula (Sarayburnu), there was a\nThracian settlement during the early 1st millennium BCE. Modern authors have\nlinked it to the Thracian toponym _Lygos_,[41] mentioned by Pliny the Elder as\nan earlier name for the site of Byzantium.[42]\n\nThe history of the city proper begins around 660 BCE,[43][a] when Greek\nsettlers from Megara established Byzantium on the European side of the\nBosphorus. The settlers built an acropolis adjacent to the Golden Horn on the\nsite of the early Thracian settlements, fueling the nascent city's\neconomy.[49] The city experienced a brief period of Persian rule at the turn\nof the 5th century BCE, but the Greeks recaptured it during the Greco-Persian\nWars.[50] Byzantium then continued as part of the Athenian League and its\nsuccessor, the Second Athenian Empire, before gaining independence in 355\nBCE.[51] Long allied with the Romans, Byzantium officially became a part of\nthe Roman Empire in 73 CE.[52] Byzantium's decision to side with the Roman\nusurper Pescennius Niger against Emperor Septimius Severus cost it dearly; by\nthe time it surrendered at the end of 195 CE, two years of siege had left the\ncity devastated.[53] Five years later, Severus began to rebuild Byzantium, and\nthe city regained\u2014and, by some accounts, surpassed\u2014its previous\nprosperity.[54]\n\n### Rise and fall of Constantinople[edit]\n\nMain article: Constantinople\n\n![A crudely drawn map depicting a walled city on a peninsula with a park, a\nnetwork of roads, and a scattering of buildings](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipe\ndia/commons/thumb/9/91/Map_of_Constantinople_%281422%29_by_Florentine_cartogra\npher_Cristoforo_Buondelmonte.jpg/170px-Map_of_Constantinople_%281422%29_by_Flo\nrentine_cartographer_Cristoforo_Buondelmonte.jpg)\n\nCreated in 1422 by Cristoforo Buondelmonti, this is the oldest surviving map\nof Constantinople.\n\nConstantine the Great effectively became the emperor of the whole of the Roman\nEmpire in September 324.[55] Two months later, he laid out the plans for a\nnew, Christian city to replace Byzantium. As the eastern capital of the\nempire, the city was named _Nea Roma_; most called it Constantinople, a name\nthat persisted into the 20th century.[56] On 11 May 330, Constantinople was\nproclaimed the capital of an empire that became known as the Byzantine Empire\nor Eastern Roman Empire.[57]\n\nThe establishment of Constantinople served as one of Constantine's most\nlasting accomplishments, shifting Roman power eastward as the city became a\ncenter of Greek culture and Christianity.[57][58] Numerous churches were built\nacross the city, including the Hagia Sophia which was built during the reign\nof Justinian the Great and remained the world's largest cathedral for a\nthousand years.[59] Constantine also undertook a major renovation and\nexpansion of the Hippodrome of Constantinople; accommodating tens of thousands\nof spectators, the hippodrome became central to civic life and, in the 5th and\n6th centuries, the epicenter of episodes of unrest, including the Nika\nriots.[60][61] Constantinople's location also ensured its existence would\nstand the test of time; for many centuries, its walls and seafront protected\nEurope against invaders from the east and the advance of Islam.[58] During\nmost of the Middle Ages, the latter part of the Byzantine era, Constantinople\nwas the largest and wealthiest city on the European continent and at times the\nlargest in the world.[62][63]\n\nConstantinople began to decline continuously after the end of the reign of\nBasil II in 1025. The final blow was given by the conquest of Villardouin and\nEnrico Dandolo in 1204 during the Fourth Crusade, where the City was sacked\nand pillaged.[64] The city subsequently became the center of the Latin Empire,\ncreated by Catholic crusaders to replace the Orthodox Byzantine Empire.[65]\nAghia Sophia was converted to a catholic church in 1204. Byzantine Empire was\nrestored, albeit weakened, in 1261.[66] Constantinople's churches, defenses,\nand basic services were in disrepair,[67] and its population had dwindled to a\nhundred thousand from half a million during the 8th century.[d] After the\nreconquest of 1261, however some of the City's monuments were restored, like\nthe 2 Deisis mosaics in Aghia Sofia and Kariye were created.\n\nVarious economic and military policies instituted by Andronikos II, such as\nthe reduction of military forces, weakened the empire and left it vulnerable\nto attack.[68] In the mid-14th-century, the Ottoman Turks began a strategy of\ngradually taking smaller towns and cities, cutting off Constantinople's supply\nroutes and strangling it slowly.[69] On 29 May 1453, after an eight-week siege\n(during which the last Roman emperor, Constantine XI, was killed), Sultan\nMehmed II \"the Conqueror\" captured Constantinople and declared it the new\ncapital of the Ottoman Empire. Hours later, the sultan rode to the Hagia\nSophia and summoned an imam to proclaim the Islamic creed, converting the\ngrand cathedral into an imperial mosque due to the city's refusal to surrender\npeacefully.[70] Mehmed declared himself as the new \"Kaysar-i R\u00fbm\" (the Ottoman\nTurkish equivalent of Caesar of Rome) and the Ottoman state was reorganized\ninto an empire.[71]\n\n### Ottoman and Turkish era[edit]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Aivazovsky_-\n_View_of_Constantinople_and_the_Bosphorus.jpg/200px-Aivazovsky_-\n_View_of_Constantinople_and_the_Bosphorus.jpg)\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d\n/Ivan_Constantinovich_Aivazovsky_-_Dusk_on_the_Golden_Horn.JPG/200px-\nIvan_Constantinovich_Aivazovsky_-_Dusk_on_the_Golden_Horn.JPG)\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/View_of_constantinople\n_by_evening_light.jpg/200px-View_of_constantinople_by_evening_light.jpg)\n\nThree paintings of Ottoman era Istanbul by Ivan Aivazovsky.\n\nFollowing the conquest of Constantinople, Mehmed II immediately set out to\nrevitalize the city, by then also known as Istanbul. He urged the return of\nthose who had fled the city during the siege, and resettled Muslims, Jews, and\nChristians from other parts of Anatolia. He demanded that five thousand\nhouseholds needed to be transferred to Constantinople by September.[72] From\nall over the Islamic empire, prisoners of war and deported people were sent to\nthe city: these people were called \"S\u00fcrg\u00fcn\" in Turkish (Greek:\n\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2).[73] However, many people escaped again from the city, and there\nwere several outbreaks of plague, so that in 1459 Mehmet allowed the deported\nGreeks to come back to the city.[74] He also invited people from all over\nEurope to his capital, creating a cosmopolitan society that persisted through\nmuch of the Ottoman period.[75] Plague continued, however, to be essentially\nendemic in Istanbul for the rest of the century, as it had been from 1520,\nwith a few years of respite between 1529 and 1533, 1549 and 1552, and from\n1567 to 1570; epidemics originating in the West and in the Hejaz and southern\nRussia.[76] Population growth in Anatolia, however, allowed Istanbul to\nreplace its losses and maintain its population of around 500,000 inhabitants\ndown to 1800. Mehmed II also repaired the city's damaged infrastructure,\nincluding the whole water system, began to build the Grand Bazaar, and\nconstructed Topkap\u0131 Palace, the sultan's official residence.[77] With the\ntransfer of the capital from Edirne (formerly Adrianople) to Constantinople,\nthe new state was declared as the successor and continuation of the Roman\nEmpire.[78]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Allom_-\n_Constantinople.jpg/220px-Allom_-_Constantinople.jpg)\n\nA painting of Ottoman era Istanbul by Thomas Allom\n\nThe Ottomans quickly transformed the city from a bastion of Christianity to a\nsymbol of Islamic culture. Religious foundations were established to fund the\nconstruction of ornate imperial mosques, often adjoined by schools, hospitals,\nand public baths.[77] The Ottoman Dynasty claimed the status of caliphate in\n1517, with Istanbul remaining the capital of this last caliphate for four\ncenturies.[12] Suleiman the Magnificent's reign from 1520 to 1566 was a period\nof especially great artistic and architectural achievement; chief architect\nMimar Sinan designed several iconic buildings in the city, while Ottoman arts\nof ceramics, stained glass, calligraphy, and miniature flourished.[79] The\npopulation of Istanbul was 570,000 by the end of the 18th century.[80]\n\nA period of rebellion at the start of the 19th century led to the rise of the\nprogressive Sultan Mahmud II and eventually to the _Tanzimat_ period, which\nproduced political reforms and allowed new technology to be introduced to the\ncity.[81] Bridges across the Golden Horn were constructed during this\nperiod,[82] and Istanbul was connected to the rest of the European railway\nnetwork in the 1880s.[83] Modern facilities, such as a water supply network,\nelectricity, telephones, and trams, were gradually introduced to Istanbul over\nthe following decades, although later than to other European cities.[84] The\nmodernization efforts were not enough to forestall the decline of the Ottoman\nEmpire.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the Young Turk Revolution deposed Sultan Abdul\nHamid II and a series of wars plagued the ailing empire's capital.[85] The\nlast of these, World War I, resulted in the British, French, and Italian\noccupation of Constantinople. The Armenian population of the city was also\naffected by the deportation of Armenian intellectuals on 24 April 1915, in\nwhich leaders of the Armenian community were arrested and mostly killed as\npart of the Armenian Genocide. To commemorate the victims of the Armenian\nGenocide, 24 April has now become the day of remembrance.[86] The final\nOttoman sultan, Mehmed VI, was exiled in November 1922; the following year,\nthe occupation of Constantinople ended with the signing of the Treaty of\nLausanne and the recognition of the Republic of Turkey, declared by Mustafa\nKemal Atat\u00fcrk.[87]\n\nIn the early years of the republic, Istanbul was overlooked in favor of\nAnkara, selected as Turkey's capital to distance the new, secular country from\nits Ottoman history.[88] From the late 1940s and early 1950s, Istanbul\nunderwent great structural change, as new public squares, boulevards, and\navenues were constructed throughout the city, sometimes at the expense of\nhistorical buildings.[89] The population of Istanbul began to rapidly increase\nin the 1970s, as people from Anatolia migrated to the city to find employment\nin the many new factories that were built on the outskirts of the sprawling\nmetropolis. This sudden, sharp rise in the city's population caused a large\ndemand for housing, and many previously outlying villages and forests became\nengulfed into the metropolitan area of Istanbul.[90]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Galata_Kulesi_%27nden_\npanorama.jpg/1550px-Galata_Kulesi_%27nden_panorama.jpg)\n\nA panoramic view of Istanbul from the Ottoman era.

The city is further divided by the Golden Horn, a\nnatural harbor bounding the peninsula where the former Byzantium and\nConstantinople were founded. The confluence of the Sea of Marmara, the\nBosphorus, and the Golden Horn at the heart of present-day Istanbul has\ndeterred attacking forces for thousands of years and remains a prominent\nfeature of the city's landscape.[58]\n\nFollowing the model of Rome, the historic peninsula is said to be\ncharacterized by seven hills, each topped by imperial mosques. The easternmost\nof these hills is the site of Topkap\u0131 Palace on the Sarayburnu.[95] Rising\nfrom the opposite side of the Golden Horn is another, conical hill, where the\nmodern Beyo\u011flu district is situated. Because of the topography, buildings in\nBeyo\u011flu were once constructed with the help of terraced retaining walls, and\nroads were laid out in the form of steps.[96] \u00dcsk\u00fcdar on the Asian side\nexhibits similarly hilly characteristics, with the terrain gradually extending\ndown to the Bosphorus coast, but the landscape in \u015eemsipa\u015fa and Ayazma is more\nabrupt, akin to a promontory. The highest point in Istanbul is \u00c7aml\u0131ca Hill,\nwith an altitude of 288 meters (945\u00a0ft).[96] The northern half of Istanbul has\na higher mean elevation compared to the south coast, with locations surpassing\n200 meters (660\u00a0ft), and some coasts with steep cliffs resembling fjords,\nespecially around the northern end of the Bosporus, where it opens up to the\nBlack Sea.\n\nIstanbul is situated near the North Anatolian Fault, close to the boundary\nbetween the African and Eurasian Plates. This fault zone, which runs from\nnorthern Anatolia to the Sea of Marmara, has been responsible for several\ndeadly earthquakes throughout the city's history. Among the most devastating\nof these seismic events was the 1509 earthquake, which caused a tsunami that\nbroke over the walls of the city and killed more than 10,000 people. More\nrecently, in 1999, an earthquake with its epicenter in nearby \u0130zmit left\n18,000 people dead, including 1,000 people in Istanbul's suburbs. The people\nof Istanbul remain concerned that an even more catastrophic seismic event may\nbe in the city's near future, as thousands of structures recently built to\naccommodate Istanbul's rapidly increasing population may not have been\nconstructed properly.[97] Seismologists say the risk of a 7.6-magnitude or\ngreater earthquake striking Istanbul by 2030 is more than 60 percent.[98][99]\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n![Skyscrapers, both near and far, soar above a dense layer of fog that keeps\nthe ground hidden from\nview.](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Fog-over-istanbul-\nskyscrapers.jpg/220px-Fog-over-istanbul-skyscrapers.jpg)\n\nFog, seen here shrouding Levent, frequently forms in the morning.\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Istanbul-\nprecipitation.png/220px-Istanbul-precipitation.png)\n\nContrasting annual precipitation differences in Istanbul, creating multiple\nmicroclimates.\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Istanbul_Koppen_Map.pn\ng/220px-Istanbul_Koppen_Map.png)\n\nMicroclimates of Istanbul according to K\u00f6ppen\u2013Geiger classification system\n\nIn the K\u00f6ppen\u2013Geiger classification system, Istanbul has a borderline\nMediterranean climate (_Csa_), humid subtropical climate (_Cfa_) and oceanic\nclimate (_Cfb_), due to its location in a transitional climatic zone. Since\nprecipitation in summer months, ranges from 20 to 65\u00a0mm (1 to 3\u00a0in), depending\non location, the city cannot be classified as solely Mediterranean or humid\nsubtropical.[100][101][102] Due to its size, diverse topography, maritime\nlocation and most importantly having a coastline to two different bodies of\nwater to the north and south, Istanbul exhibits microclimates. The northern\nhalf of the city, as well as the Bosporus coastline, express characteristics\nof oceanic and humid subtropical climates, because of humidity from the Black\nSea and the relatively high concentration of vegetation. The climate in the\npopulated areas of the city to the south, located on the Sea of Marmara, is\nwarmer, drier and less affected by humidity.[103] The annual precipitation in\nthe northern half can be twice as much (Bah\u00e7ek\u00f6y, 1166.6\u00a0mm), than it is in\nthe southern, Marmara coast (Florya 635.0\u00a0mm).[104] There is a significant\ndifference between annual mean temperatures on the north and south coasts as\nwell, Bah\u00e7ek\u00f6y 12.8\u00a0\u00b0C (55.0\u00a0\u00b0F), Kartal 15.03\u00a0\u00b0C (59.05\u00a0\u00b0F).[105] Parts of\nthe province, that are away from both seas exhibit considerable continental\ninfluences, with much more pronounced night-day and summer-winter temperature\ndifferences. In winter some parts of the province average freezing or below at\nnight.\n\nIstanbul's persistently high humidity reaches 80 percent most mornings.[106]\nBecause of this, fog is very common, although more so in northern parts of the\ncity and away from the city center.[103] Dense fog disrupts transportation in\nthe region, including on the Bosphorus, and is common during the autumn and\nwinter months when the humidity remains high into the\nafternoon.[107][108][109] The humid conditions and the fog tend to dissipate\nby midday during the summer months, but the lingering humidity exacerbates the\nmoderately high summer temperatures.[106][110] During these summer months,\nhigh temperatures average around 29\u00a0\u00b0C (84\u00a0\u00b0F) and rainfall is uncommon; there\nare only about fifteen days with measurable precipitation between June and\nAugust.[111] The summer months also have the highest concentration of\nthunderstorms.[112]\n\nWinter is colder in Istanbul than in most other cities around the\nMediterranean Basin, with low temperatures averaging 1\u20134\u00a0\u00b0C (34\u201339\u00a0\u00b0F).[111]\nLake-effect snow from the Black Sea is common, although difficult to forecast,\nwith the potential to be heavy and\u2014as with the fog\u2014disruptive to the city's\ninfrastructure.[113] Spring and autumn are mild, but often wet and\nunpredictable; chilly winds from the northwest and warm gusts from the\nsouth\u2014sometimes in the same day\u2014tend to cause fluctuations in\ntemperature.[110][114] Overall, Istanbul has an annual average of 130 days\nwith significant precipitation, which amounts to 810 millimeters (31.9\u00a0in) per\nyear.[111][115] The highest and lowest temperatures ever recorded in the city\ncenter on the Marmara coast are 40.5\u00a0\u00b0C (105\u00a0\u00b0F) and \u221216.1\u00a0\u00b0C (3\u00a0\u00b0F). The\ngreatest rainfall recorded in a day is 227 millimeters (8.9\u00a0in), and the\nhighest recorded snow cover is 80 centimeters (31\u00a0in).[116][117]\n\nClimate data for Istanbul (Sar\u0131yer),

across from the Genoese citadel of Galata. Those Genoese\nfortifications were largely demolished in the 19th century, leaving only the\nGalata Tower, to make way for northward expansion of the city.[121] Galata is\nnow part of the Beyo\u011flu district, which forms Istanbul's commercial and\nentertainment center on Taksim Square.[122]\n\nDolmabah\u00e7e Palace, the seat of government during the late Ottoman period, is\nlocated in Be\u015fikta\u015f, just south of Beyo\u011flu, across from BJK \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc Stadium,\nhome to Turkey's oldest sports club. The main administration building of the\nOttoman Empire was the \"Sublime Porte\" or BaabiAli a huge building in the old\nCity.[123] The former village of Ortak\u00f6y is situated within Be\u015fikta\u015f and gives\nits name to the Ortak\u00f6y Mosque, along the Bosphorus near the First Bosphorus\nBridge. Lining the shores of the Bosphorus north of there are _yal\u0131s_,\nluxurious chalet mansions originally built by 19th-century aristocrats and\nelites as summer homes.[124] Farther inland, outside the city's inner ring\nroad, are Levent and Maslak, Istanbul's primary economic centers.[125]\n\n![Two- and three-story colored houses with docks and balconies, built directly\non the edge of the water](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/\nYa%C4%9Fl%C4%B1k%C3%A7%C4%B1_Hac%C4%B1_Re%C5%9Fit_Bey_and_Prenses_Rukiye_Yal%C\n4%B1s%C4%B1_on_the_Bosphorus%2C_Istanbul%2C_Turkey_001.jpg/220px-Ya%C4%9Fl%C4%\nB1k%C3%A7%C4%B1_Hac%C4%B1_Re%C5%9Fit_Bey_and_Prenses_Rukiye_Yal%C4%B1s%C4%B1_o\nn_the_Bosphorus%2C_Istanbul%2C_Turkey_001.jpg)\n\nOriginally outside the city, _yal\u0131_ residences along the Bosphorus are now\nhomes in some of Istanbul's elite neighborhoods.\n\nDuring the Ottoman period, \u00dcsk\u00fcdar and Kad\u0131k\u00f6y were outside the scope of urban\nIstanbul, serving as tranquil outposts with seaside _yal\u0131s_ and gardens.\nDuring the second half of the 20th century, the Asian side experienced major\nurban growth; the late development of this part of the city led to better\ninfrastructure and tidier urban planning when compared with most other\nresidential areas in the city.[10] Much of the Asian side of the Bosphorus\nfunctions as a suburb of the economic and commercial centers in European\nIstanbul, accounting for a third of the city's population but only a quarter\nof its employment.[10] As a result of Istanbul's exponential growth during the\n20th century, a significant portion of the city is composed of _gecekondus_\n(literally \"built overnight\"), referring to illegally constructed squatter\nbuildings.[126] At present, some _gecekondu_ areas are being gradually\ndemolished and replaced by modern mass-housing compounds.[127] Moreover, large\nscale gentrification and urban renewal projects have been taking place,[128]\nsuch as the one in Tarlaba\u015f\u0131;[129] some of these projects, like the one in\nSulukule, have faced criticism.[130] The Turkish government also has ambitious\nplans for an expansion of the city west and northwards on the European side in\nconjunction with plans for a third airport and the city's Olympic bid; the new\nparts of the city will include four different settlements with specified urban\nfunctions, housing 1.5 million people.[131]\n\nIstanbul does not have a primary urban park, but it does have several green\nareas. G\u00fclhane Park and Y\u0131ld\u0131z Park were originally included within the\ngrounds of two of Istanbul's palaces\u2014Topkap\u0131 Palace and Y\u0131ld\u0131z Palace\u2014but they\nwere repurposed as public parks in the early decades of the Turkish\nRepublic.[132] Another park, Fethi Pa\u015fa Korusu, is situated on a hillside\nadjacent to the Bosphorus Bridge in Anatolia, opposite Y\u0131ld\u0131z Palace. Along\nthe European side, and closer to the Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge, is Emirgan\nPark; originally a private estate belonging to Ottoman leaders, the 47-hectare\n(120-acre) park is known for its diversity of plants and an annual tulip\nfestival held since 2005.[133] Popular during the summer among Istanbulites is\nBelgrad Forest, spreading across 5,500 hectares (14,000 acres) at the northern\nedge of the city. The forest originally supplied water to the city and\nremnants of reservoirs used during Byzantine and Ottoman times\nsurvive.[134][135]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Istanbul_panorama_and_\nskyline.jpg/800px-Istanbul_panorama_and_skyline.jpg)\n\nPanoramic view of Istanbul from the confluence of the Bosphorus and the Sea of\nMarmara.

They were designed by members of the Balyan family of Ottoman\ncourt architects.[136]\n\nIstanbul is primarily known for its Byzantine and Ottoman architecture, but\nits buildings reflect the various peoples and empires that have previously\nruled the city. Examples of Genoese and Roman architecture remain visible in\nIstanbul alongside their Ottoman counterparts. Nothing of the architecture of\nthe classical Greek period has survived, but Roman architecture has proved to\nbe more durable. The obelisk erected by Theodosius in the Hippodrome of\nConstantinople is still visible in Sultanahmet Square, and a section of the\nValens Aqueduct, constructed in the late 4th century, stands relatively intact\nat the western edge of the Fatih district.[137] The Column of Constantine,\nerected in 330 CE to mark the new Roman capital, stands not far from the\nHippodrome.[137]\n\nEarly Byzantine architecture followed the classical Roman model of domes and\narches, but improved upon these elements, as in the Church of the Saints\nSergius and Bacchus. The oldest surviving Byzantine church in Istanbul\u2014albeit\nin ruins\u2014is the Monastery of Stoudios (later converted into the Imrahor\nMosque), which was built in 454.[138] After the recapture of Constantinople in\n1261, the Byzantines enlarged two of the most important churches extant, Chora\nChurch and Pammakaristos Church. The pinnacle of Byzantine architecture, and\none of Istanbul's most iconic structures, is the Hagia Sophia. Topped by a\ndome 31 meters (102\u00a0ft) in diameter,[139] the Hagia Sophia stood as the\nworld's largest cathedral for centuries, and was later converted into a mosque\nand, as it stands now, a museum.[59]\n\nAmong the oldest surviving examples of Ottoman architecture in Istanbul are\nthe Anadoluhisar\u0131 and Rumelihisar\u0131 fortresses, which assisted the Ottomans\nduring their siege of the city.[140] Over the next four centuries, the\nOttomans made an indelible impression on the skyline of Istanbul, building\ntowering mosques and ornate palaces. The largest palace, Topkap\u0131, includes a\ndiverse array of architectural styles, from Baroque inside the Harem, to its\nNeoclassical style Ender\u00fbn Library.[141] The imperial mosques include Fatih\nMosque, Bayezid Mosque, Yavuz Selim Mosque, S\u00fcleymaniye Mosque, Sultan Ahmed\nMosque (the Blue Mosque), and Yeni Mosque, all of which were built at the peak\nof the Ottoman Empire, in the 16th and 17th centuries. In the following\ncenturies, and especially after the _Tanzimat_ reforms, Ottoman architecture\nwas supplanted by European styles.[142] An example of which is the imperial\nNuruosmaniye Mosque. Areas around \u0130stiklal Avenue were filled with grand\nEuropean embassies and rows of buildings in Neoclassical, Renaissance Revival\nand Art Nouveau styles, which went on to influence the architecture of a\nvariety of structures in Beyo\u011flu\u2014including churches, stores, and theaters\u2014and\nofficial buildings such as Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace.[143]\n\n## Administration[edit]\n\nMain articles: List of districts of Istanbul and List of neighbourhoods of\nIstanbul\n\n![A map depicting districts, squeezed between two bodies of water; farther\ndistricts are very large compared to those clustered in the center.](//upload.\nwikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Istanbul_location_districts.svg\n/340px-Istanbul_location_districts.svg.png)\n\nIstanbul's districts extend far from the city center, along the full length of\nthe Bosphorus (with the Black Sea at the top and the Sea of Marmara at the\nbottom of the map).\n\nSince 2004, the municipal boundaries of Istanbul have been coincident with the\nboundaries of its province.[144] The city, considered capital of Istanbul\nProvince, is administered by the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (MMI),\nwhich oversees the 39 districts of the city-province.[c]\n\nThe current city structure can be traced back to the _Tanzimat_ period of\nreform in the 19th century, before which Islamic judges and imams led the city\nunder the auspices of the Grand Vizier. Following the model of French cities,\nthis religious system was replaced by a mayor and a citywide council composed\nof representatives of the confessional groups (_millet_) across Istanbul.\nBeyo\u011flu was the first area of the city to have its own director and council,\nwith members instead being longtime residents of the neighborhood.[145] Laws\nenacted after the Ottoman constitution of 1876 aimed to expand this structure\nacross the city, imitating the twenty arrondissements of Paris, but they were\nnot fully implemented until 1908, when Istanbul was declared a province with\nnine constituent districts.[146][147] This system continued beyond the\nfounding of the Turkish Republic, with the province renamed a _belediye_\n(municipality), but the municipality was disbanded in 1957.[92][148]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Adalar_5536.jpg/220px-\nAdalar_5536.jpg)\n\nStatue of Atat\u00fcrk in B\u00fcy\u00fckada, the largest of the Prince Islands to the\nsoutheast of Istanbul, which collectively form the Adalar (_Isles_) district\nof Istanbul Province.\n\nSmall settlements adjacent to major population centers in Turkey, including\nIstanbul, were merged into their respective primary cities during the early\n1980s, resulting in metropolitan municipalities.[149][150] The main decision-\nmaking body of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality is the Municipal\nCouncil, with members drawn from district councils.\n\nThe Municipal Council is responsible for citywide issues, including managing\nthe budget, maintaining civic infrastructure, and overseeing museums and major\ncultural centers.[151] Since the government operates under a \"powerful mayor,\nweak council\" approach, the council's leader\u2014the metropolitan mayor\u2014has the\nauthority to make swift decisions, often at the expense of transparency.[152]\nThe Municipal Council is advised by the Metropolitan Executive Committee,\nalthough the Committee also has limited power to make decisions of its\nown.[153] All representatives on the Committee are appointed by the\nmetropolitan mayor and the Council, with the mayor\u2014or someone of his or her\nchoosing\u2014serving as head.[153][154]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Taksim_Square_2012.jpg\n/220px-Taksim_Square_2012.jpg)\n\nA view of Taksim Square with the Monument of the Republic which was opened in\n1928.\n\nDistrict councils are chiefly responsible for waste management and\nconstruction projects within their respective districts. They each maintain\ntheir own budgets, although the metropolitan mayor reserves the right to\nreview district decisions. One-fifth of all district council members,\nincluding the district mayors, also represent their districts in the Municipal\nCouncil.[151] All members of the district councils and the Municipal Council,\nincluding the metropolitan mayor, are elected to five-year terms.[155]\nRepresenting the Justice and Development Party, Kadir Topba\u015f has been Mayor of\nIstanbul since March 2004.[156]\n\nWith the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality and Istanbul Province having\nequivalent jurisdictions, few responsibilities remain for the provincial\ngovernment. Similar to the MMI, the Istanbul Special Provincial Administration\nhas a governor, a democratically elected decision-making body\u2014the Provincial\nParliament\u2014and an appointed Executive Committee. Mirroring the executive\ncommittee at the municipal level, the Provincial Executive Committee includes\na secretary-general and leaders of departments that advise the Provincial\nParliament.[154][157] The Provincial Administration's duties are largely\nlimited to the building and maintenance of schools, residences, government\nbuildings, and roads, and the promotion of arts, culture, and nature\nconservation.[158] H\u00fcseyin Avni Mutlu has been Governor of Istanbul Province\nsince May 2010.[159]\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\nSee also: Demographics of Turkey and Istanbul Province\n\n**Historical populations** | Pre-Republic  \n---  \nYear | Pop.  \n100 | 36,000  \n361 | 300,000  \n500 | 400,000  \n7th c. | 150\u2013350,000  \n8th c. | 125\u2013500,000  \n9th c. | 50\u2013250,000  \n1000 | 150\u2013300,000  \n1100 | 200,000  \n1200 | 150,000  \n1261 | 100,000  \n1350 | 80,000  \n1453 | 45,000  \n1500 | 200,000  \n1550 | 660,000  \n1700 | 700,000  \n1815 | 500,000  \n1860 | 715,000  \n1890 | 874,000  \n1900 | 942,900  \n| Republic  \n---  \nYear | Pop. | \u00b1%  \n1925 | 881,000 | \u2014  \n1927 | 691,000 | \u221221.6%  \n1935 | 740,800 | +7.2%  \n1940 | 793,900 | +7.2%  \n1945 | 845,300 | +6.5%  \n1950 | 983,000 | +16.3%  \n1960 | 1,459,500 | +48.5%  \n1965 | 1,743,000 | +19.4%  \n1970 | 2,132,400 | +22.3%  \n1975 | 2,547,400 | +19.5%  \n1980 | 2,853,500 | +12.0%  \n1985 | 5,494,900 | +92.6%  \n1990 | 6,620,200 | +20.5%  \n1994 | 7,615,500 | +15.0%  \n1997 | 8,260,400 | +8.5%  \n2000 | 8,831,800 | +6.9%  \n2007 | 11,174,200 | +26.5%  \n2014 | 14,000,000 | +25.3%  \nSources: Jan Lahmeyer 2004,Chandler 1987, Morris 2010,Turan 2010  \nPre-Republic figures estimated[d]  \n  \n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Greeks_in_Istanbul_184\n4_1997.png/300px-Greeks_in_Istanbul_1844_1997.png)\n\nGreek population in Istanbul and percentages of the city population\n(1844-1997).

By 500 CE, Constantinople had somewhere between 400,000 and\n500,000 people, edging out its predecessor, Rome, for world's largest\ncity.[161] Constantinople jostled with other major historical cities, such as\nBaghdad, Chang'an, Kaifeng and Merv for the position of world's most populous\ncity until the 12th century. It never returned to being the world's largest,\nbut remained Europe's largest city from 1500 to 1750, when it was surpassed by\nLondon.[162]\n\nThe Turkish Statistical Institute estimates that the population of Istanbul\nMetropolitan Municipality was 14,377,019 at the end of 2014, hosting 19\npercent of the country's population.[6] Other estimate that at the same time\nthe population within city limits was 14,025,646.[4] Then about 97-98% of the\ninhabitants of the metropolitan municipality were within city limits, up from\n89% in 2007[163] and 61% in 1980.[164] 64.7% of the residents live on the\nEuropean side and 35.3% on the Asian side.[165] While the city ranks as\nworld's 5th-largest city proper, it drops the rank to the 24th place as an\nurban area and to the 18th place as a metro area because the city limits are\nroughly equivalent to the agglomeration. Today, it forms one of the largest\nurban agglomerations in Europe, alongside Moscow.[e] The city's annual\npopulation growth of 3.45 percent ranks as the highest among the seventy-eight\nlargest metropolises in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and\nDevelopment. The high population growth mirrors an urbanization trend across\nthe country, as the second and third fastest-growing OECD metropolises are the\nTurkish cities of \u0130zmir and Ankara.[19]\n\nIstanbul experienced especially rapid growth during the second half of the\n20th century, with its population increasing tenfold between 1950 and\n2000.[14] This growth in population comes, in part, from an expansion of city\nlimits\u2014particularly between 1980 and 1985, when the number of Istanbulites\nnearly doubled.[92] The remarkable growth was, and still is, largely fueled by\nmigrants from eastern Turkey seeking employment and improved living\nconditions. The number of residents of Istanbul originating from seven\nnorthern and eastern provinces is greater than the populations of their entire\nrespective provinces; Sivas and Kastamonu each account for more than half a\nmillion residents of Istanbul.[15] Istanbul's foreign population, by\ncomparison, is very small, 42,228 residents in 2007.[168] Only 28 percent of\nthe city's residents are originally from Istanbul.[169] The most densely\npopulated areas tend to lie to the northwest, west, and southwest of the city\ncenter, on the European side; the most densely populated district on the Asian\nside is \u00dcsk\u00fcdar.[15]\n\n### Religious and ethnic groups[edit]\n\nMain article: Religion in Istanbul\n\nSee also: Kurds in Turkey, Bosniaks in Turkey, Greeks in Turkey, Armenians in\nTurkey, Jews in Turkey and Albanians in Turkey\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Patrik-Rum.jpg/220px-\nPatrik-Rum.jpg)\n\nEcumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople jurisdictions where members live\n\nIstanbul has been a cosmopolitan city throughout much of its history, but it\nhas become more homogenized since the end of the Ottoman Empire. Most of\nTurkey's religious and ethnic minorities remain concentrated in Istanbul. The\nvast majority of people across Turkey, and in Istanbul, consider themselves\nMuslim, and more specifically members of the Sunni branch of Islam. Most\nSunnis follow the Hanafi school of Islamic thought, although approximately 10\npercent of Sunnis follow the Shafi'i school. The largest non-Sunni Muslim\nsect, accounting for 4.5 million Turks, is the Alevis; a third of all Alevis\nin the country live in Istanbul.[169] Mystic movements, like Sufism, were\nofficially banned after the establishment of the Turkish Republic, but they\nstill boast numerous followers.[170]\n\nThe Patriarch of Constantinople has been designated Ecumenical Patriarch since\nthe sixth century, and has subsequently come to be widely regarded as the\nleader of the world's 300 million Orthodox Christians.[171] Since 1601, the\nPatriarchate has been based in Istanbul's Church of St. George.[172] Into the\n19th century, the Christians of Istanbul tended to be either Greek Orthodox or\nmembers of the Armenian Apostolic Church.[173] The headquarters of the Turkish\nOrthodox Church are located in the city. Because of events during the 20th\ncentury\u2014including the 1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey, a\n1942 wealth tax, and the 1955 Istanbul riots\u2014the Greek population, originally\ncentered in Fener and Samatya, has decreased substantially. At the start of\nthe 21st century, Istanbul's Greek population numbered 3,000 (down from\n130,000 in 1923 and 260,000 according to the Ottoman Census of 1910 of 850,000\ntotal).[174][175] There are today between 50,000 and 70,000 Armenians in\nIstanbul, down from 164,000 in 1913 partly due to the Armenian Genocide.[176]\nChristians made up half the population of the city in 1910.[177]\n\nThe largest ethnic minority in Istanbul is the Kurdish community, originating\nfrom eastern and southeastern Turkey. Although the Kurdish presence in the\ncity dates back to the early Ottoman period,[178] the influx of Kurds into the\ncity has accelerated since the beginning of the Kurdish\u2013Turkish conflict with\nthe Kurdistan Workers' Party (i.e. since the late 1970s).[179] About two to\nthree million residents of Istanbul are Kurdish, meaning there are more Kurds\nin Istanbul than in any other city in the world.[180][181][182][183][184]\nThere are other significant ethnic minorities as well, the Bosniaks are the\nmain people of an entire district - Bayrampa\u015fa.[185] The neighborhood of Balat\nused to be home to a sizable Sephardi Jewish community, first formed during\nthe period of the Spanish Inquisition.[186] Romaniotes and Ashkenazi Jews\nresided in Istanbul even before the Sephardim, but their proportion has since\ndwindled; today, 1 percent of Istanbul's Jews are Ashkenazi.[187][188] In\nlarge part due to emigration to Israel, the Jewish population nationwide\ndropped from 100,000 in 1950 to 18,000 in 2005, with the majority of them\nliving in either Istanbul or \u0130zmir.[189] Levantines, Latin Christians who\nsettled in Galata during the Ottoman period, played a seminal role in shaping\nthe culture and architecture of Istanbul during the 19th and early 20th\ncenturies; their population has dwindled, but they remain in the city in small\nnumbers.[190] From the increase in mutual cooperation between Turkey and\nseveral African States like Somalia and Djibouti, several young students and\nworkers have been migrating to Istanbul in search of better education and\nemployment opportunities. There is also a small Nigerian, Congolese and\nCameroonian and North African community present.[191]\n\n## Politics[edit]\n\n\u0130stanbul district Municipalities  \nTurkish local elections, 2014  \n![\u0130stanbul 2014.png](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/%C4%B\n0stanbul_2014.png/220px-%C4%B0stanbul_2014.png)  \n---  \nAK Party |\n\n25 / 39  \n  \nCHP |\n\n14 / 39  \n  \nMembers of Parliament for \u0130stanbul  \nTurkish general election, June 2015  \n![\u0130stanbul2015.png](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/%C4%B0\nstanbul2015.png/220px-%C4%B0stanbul2015.png)  \n---  \nAK Party |\n\n39 / 88  \n  \nCHP |\n\n28 / 88  \n  \nHDP |\n\n11 / 88  \n  \nMHP |\n\n10 / 88  \n  \nIstanbul has voted for the winning party in general elections since 1995.\nSince 2002, the right-wing Justice and Development Party (AKP) has won\npluralities in every general and local election.

Turkish President and former AKP Prime\nMinister Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan was elected Mayor of \u0130stanbul in the 1994 local\nelections as the Islamist Welfare Party candidate with 25.1% of the vote,\nwinning due to a vote split between the mainstream centrist parties.\nConservative parties traditionally find support in older districts with high\npopulation densities such as Ba\u011fc\u0131lar, Fatih, Sultanbeyli and Esenler. The\nopposition Kemalist center-left Republican People's Party (CHP), currently the\nsecond major political force in both \u0130stanbul and the country, gets most of\nits support from more rural districts such as Silivri, \u00c7atalca and Sar\u0131yer.\nUrban districts such as Be\u015fikta\u015f, Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y, \u015ei\u015fli and Kad\u0131k\u00f6y have returned\nstrong support for the CHP in past elections.

Since \u0130stanbul is\nTurkey's largest city and has usually voted in the same way as the country as\na whole, it is largely perceived in Turkish politics that the winning party of\nan election is essentially decided by \u0130stanbul's electorate. Political parties\nthus allocate substantial amounts of electoral campaign funds and to winning\ncontrol of the \u0130stanbul Metropolitan Municipality. Due to its electoral\nimportance, \u0130stanbul has reported the largest and most serious cases of\nelectoral fraud in recent elections, including the 2014 local\nelections.[192][193][194][195][196][197][198]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Istanbul_Municipality_\nCity_Hall.jpg/220px-Istanbul_Municipality_City_Hall.jpg)\n\nIstanbul Metropolitan Municipality building in the Fatih district\n\nThe incumbent mayor of the city is Kadir Topba\u015f of the AKP, who was first\nelected in the 2004 local elections and succeeded Ali M\u00fcfit G\u00fcrtuna of the\nclosed down Welfare Party. He was re-elected in 2009 and 2014. The leader of\nthe CHP and parliamentary opposition, Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, ran against Topba\u015f\nin the 2009 local elections. He is currently a Member of Parliament for\n\u0130stanbul. Between 2007 and 2014, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan was also\nan MP for \u0130stanbul. For general elections, the city is divided into 3\nelectoral districts and returns 85 MPs to the Turkish parliament. In the 2014\npresidential election, 49.83% of the city's electorate voted for AKP candidate\nRecep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. Although Erdo\u011fan won the most votes in \u0130stanbul, his\nfailure to win above 50% was seen as significant.

With its high population and significant\ncontribution to the Turkish economy, Istanbul is responsible for two-fifths of\nthe nation's tax revenue.[19] That includes the taxes of 37 billionaires based\nin Istanbul, the fifth-highest number among cities around the world.[202]\n\nAs expected for a city of its size, Istanbul has a diverse industrial economy,\nproducing commodities as varied as olive oil, tobacco, vehicles, and\nelectronics.[201] Despite having a focus on high-value-added work, its low-\nvalue-added manufacturing sector is substantial, representing just 26 percent\nof Istanbul's GDP, but four-fifths of the city's total exports.[19] In 2005,\ncompanies based in Istanbul produced exports worth $41.4 billion and received\nimports totaling $69.9 billion; these figures were equivalent to 57 percent\nand 60 percent, respectively, of the national totals.[203]\n\nIstanbul is home to Borsa Istanbul, the sole exchange entity of Turkey, which\ncombined the former Istanbul Stock Exchange, the Istanbul Gold Exchange, and\nthe Derivatives Exchange of Turkey.[204] The former Istanbul Stock Exchange\nwas originally established as the Ottoman Stock Exchange in 1866.[205] During\nthe 19th and early 20th centuries, Bankalar Caddesi (Banks Street) in Galata\nwas the financial center of the Ottoman Empire, where the Ottoman Stock\nExchange was located.[206] Bankalar Caddesi continued to be Istanbul's main\nfinancial district until the 1990s, when most Turkish banks began moving their\nheadquarters to the modern central business districts of Levent and Maslak. In\n1995, the Istanbul Stock Exchange (now Borsa Istanbul) moved to its current\nbuilding in the \u0130stinye quarter of the Sar\u0131yer district.[207] A new central\nbusiness district is also under construction in Ata\u015fehir and will host the\nheadquarters of various Turkish banks and financial institutions upon\ncompletion.[208]\n\n![A pair of large ships sailing on a waterway, with a suspension bridge and\nhilly terrain in the background.](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thu\nmb/5/5f/Ships_under_Second_Bosphorus_Bridge_%28September_2011%29.jpg/220px-\nShips_under_Second_Bosphorus_Bridge_%28September_2011%29.jpg)\n\nAs a route to the Black Sea, the Bosphorus is one of the busiest waterways in\nthe world.\n\nAs the only sea route between the oil-rich Black Sea and the Mediterranean,\nthe Bosphorus is one of the busiest waterways in the world; more than 200\nmillion tonnes of oil pass through the strait each year, and the traffic on\nthe Bosphorus is three times that on the Suez Canal.[209] As a result, there\nhave been proposals to build a canal, known as Canal Istanbul, parallel to the\nstrait, on the European side of the city.[210] Istanbul has three major\nshipping ports\u2014the Port of Haydarpa\u015fa, the Port of Ambarl\u0131, and the Port of\nZeytinburnu\u2014as well as several smaller ports and oil terminals along the\nBosphorus and the Sea of Marmara.[211][212] Haydarpa\u015fa, situated at the\nsoutheastern end of the Bosphorus, was Istanbul's largest port until the early\n2000s. Shifts in operations to Ambarl\u0131 since then have left Haydarpa\u015fa running\nunder capacity and with plans to decommission the port.[213] In 2007, Ambarl\u0131,\non the western edge of the urban center, had an annual capacity of 1.5 million\nTEUs (compared to 354,000 TEUs at Haydarpa\u015fa), making it the fourth-largest\ncargo terminal in the Mediterranean basin.[214][215] The Port of Zeytinburnu\nis advantaged by its proximity to motorways and Atat\u00fcrk International\nAirport,[216] and long-term plans for the city call for greater connectivity\nbetween all terminals and the road and rail networks.[217]\n\nIstanbul is an increasingly popular tourist destination; whereas just 2.4\nmillion foreigners visited the city in 2000, it welcomed 12.56 million foreign\ntourists in 2015, making it the world's fifth most-visited city.[16][218]\nIstanbul is Turkey's second-largest international gateway, after Antalya,\nreceiving a quarter of the nation's foreign tourists. Istanbul's tourist\nindustry is concentrated in the European side, with 90 percent of the city's\nhotels located there. Low- and mid-range hotels tend to be located on the\nSarayburnu; higher-end hotels are primarily located in the entertainment and\nfinancial centers north of the Golden Horn. Istanbul's seventy museums, the\nmost visited of which are the Topkap\u0131 Palace Museum and the Hagia Sophia,\nbring in $30 million in revenue each year.

Despite efforts to make Ankara Turkey's cultural heart, Istanbul\nhad the country's primary institution of art until the 1970s.[224] When\nadditional universities and art journals were founded in Istanbul during the\n1980s, artists formerly based in Ankara moved in.[225] Beyo\u011flu has been\ntransformed into the artistic center of the city, with young artists and older\nTurkish artists formerly residing abroad finding footing there. Modern art\nmuseums, including \u0130stanbul Modern, the Pera Museum, Sak\u0131p Sabanc\u0131 Museum and\nSantralIstanbul, opened in the 2000s to complement the exhibition spaces and\nauction houses that have already contributed to the cosmopolitan nature of the\ncity.[226] These museums have yet to attain the popularity of older museums on\nthe historic peninsula, including the Istanbul Archaeology Museums, which\nushered in the era of modern museums in Turkey, and the Turkish and Islamic\nArts Museum.[219][220]\n\nThe first film screening in Turkey was at Y\u0131ld\u0131z Palace in 1896, a year after\nthe technology publicly debuted in Paris.[227] Movie theaters rapidly cropped\nup in Beyo\u011flu, with the greatest concentration of theaters being along the\nstreet now known as \u0130stiklal Avenue.[228] Istanbul also became the heart of\nTurkey's nascent film industry, although Turkish films were not consistently\ndeveloped until the 1950s.[229] Since then, Istanbul has been the most popular\nlocation to film Turkish dramas and comedies.[230] The Turkish film industry\nramped up in the second half of the century, and with _Uzak_ (2002) and _My\nFather and My Son_ (2005), both filmed in Istanbul, the nation's movies began\nto see substantial international success.[231] Istanbul and its picturesque\nskyline have also served as a backdrop for several foreign films, including\n_Topkapi_ (1964), _The World Is Not Enough_ (1999), and _Mission Istaanbul_\n(2008).[232]\n\nCoinciding with this cultural reemergence was the establishment of the\nIstanbul Festival, which began showcasing a variety of art from Turkey and\naround the world in 1973. From this flagship festival came the International\nIstanbul Film Festival and the Istanbul International Jazz Festival in the\nearly 1980s. With its focus now solely on music and dance, the Istanbul\nFestival has been known as the Istanbul International Music Festival since\n1994.[233] The most prominent of the festivals that evolved from the original\nIstanbul Festival is the Istanbul Biennial, held every two years since 1987.\nIts early incarnations were aimed at showcasing Turkish visual art, and it has\nsince opened to international artists and risen in prestige to join the elite\nbiennales, alongside the Venice Biennale and the S\u00e3o Paulo Art Biennial.[234]\n\n### Leisure and entertainment[edit]\n\n![Goods overflow out of storefronts, leaving a narrow passageway where\nshoppers move about.](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa\n/Grand-Bazaar_Shop.jpg/220px-Grand-Bazaar_Shop.jpg)\n\nThe Grand Bazaar is one of the largest covered markets in the world.\n\nIstanbul has numerous shopping centers, from the historic to the modern. The\nGrand Bazaar, in operation since 1461, is among the world's oldest and largest\ncovered markets.[235][236] Mahmutpasha Bazaar is an open-air market extending\nbetween the Grand Bazaar and the Egyptian Bazaar, which has been Istanbul's\nmajor spice market since 1660. Galleria Atak\u00f6y ushered in the age of modern\nshopping malls in Turkey when it opened in 1987.[237] Since then, malls have\nbecome major shopping centers outside the historic peninsula. Akmerkez was\nawarded the titles of \"Europe's best\" and \"World's best\" shopping mall by the\nInternational Council of Shopping Centers in 1995 and 1996; Istanbul Cevahir\nhas been one of the continent's largest since opening in 2005; Kanyon won the\nCityscape Architectural Review Award in the Commercial Built category in\n2006.[236] \u0130stinye Park in \u0130stinye and Zorlu Center near Levent are among the\nnewest malls which include the stores of the world's top fashion brands. Abdi\n\u0130pek\u00e7i Street in Ni\u015fanta\u015f\u0131 and Ba\u011fdat Avenue on the Anatolian side of the city\nhave evolved into high-end shopping districts.[238][239]\n\n![A large tree decorated under the night sky in red and green and surrounded\nby spotlights, city lights, and mid-rise buildings](//upload.wikimedia.org/wik\nipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Ni%C5%9Fanta%C5%9F%C4%B1_2010-11_Y%C4%B1lba%C5%9F%C4\n%B1_S%C3%BCslemeleri.jpg/220px-\nNi%C5%9Fanta%C5%9F%C4%B1_2010-11_Y%C4%B1lba%C5%9F%C4%B1_S%C3%BCslemeleri.jpg)\n\nNew Year's Eve decorations in Ni\u015fanta\u015f\u0131 shopping district\n\nAside from typical Turkish cuisine like kebab, Istanbul is also famous for its\nhistoric seafood restaurants.

Kumkap\u0131 along the Sea of Marmara has a pedestrian zone that hosts\naround fifty fish restaurants.[240] The Princes' Islands, 15 kilometers (9\u00a0mi)\nfrom the city center, are also popular for their seafood restaurants. Because\nof their restaurants, historic summer mansions, and tranquil, car-free\nstreets, the Princes' Islands are a popular vacation destination among\nIstanbulites and foreign tourists.[241]\n\nRestaurants featuring foreign cuisines are mainly concentrated in the Beyo\u011flu,\nBe\u015fikta\u015f, \u015ei\u015fli and Kad\u0131k\u00f6y districts. Along \u0130stiklal Avenue is the \u00c7i\u00e7ek\nPasaj\u0131, now home to winehouses (known as _meyhanes_), pubs, and\nrestaurants.[242] \u0130stiklal Avenue, originally famous for its taverns, has\nshifted toward shopping, but the nearby Nevizade Street is still lined with\nwinehouses and pubs.[243][244] Some other neighborhoods around \u0130stiklal Avenue\nhave recently been revamped to cater to Beyo\u011flu's nightlife, with formerly\ncommercial streets now lined with pubs, cafes, and restaurants playing live\nmusic.[245] Other focal points for Istanbul's nightlife include Ni\u015fanta\u015f\u0131,\nOrtak\u00f6y, Bebek, and Kad\u0131k\u00f6y.[246]\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\nSee also: List of sport facilities in Istanbul\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Atat%C3%BCrk_Olimpiyat\n.jpg/200px-Atat%C3%BCrk_Olimpiyat.jpg)\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Ali_Sami_Yen_Spor_Komp\nleksi_T%C3%BCrk_Telekom_Arena2.jpg/200px-\nAli_Sami_Yen_Spor_Kompleksi_T%C3%BCrk_Telekom_Arena2.jpg)\n\nAtat\u00fcrk Olympic Stadium (top)  \nT\u00fcrk Telekom Arena (bottom)\n\nIstanbul has some of Turkey's oldest sports clubs.

The industry has its roots in the former\nOttoman capital, where the first Turkish newspaper, _Takvim-i Vekayi_\n(Calendar of Affairs), was published in 1831. The Ca\u011falo\u011flu street on which\nthe newspaper was printed, B\u00e2b-\u0131 \u00c2li Street, rapidly became the center of\nTurkish print media, alongside Beyo\u011flu across the Golden Horn.[267]\n\nToday, Istanbul hosts a wide variety of periodicals. Most nationwide\nnewspapers are based in Istanbul, with simultaneous Ankara and \u0130zmir\neditions.[268] Istanbul-based _Zaman_, although only founded in 1986, is\nTurkey's most widely circulated paper, with a weekly distribution of more than\none million, twice that of its nearest competitor. _Posta_, _H\u00fcrriyet_, and\n_S\u00f6zc\u00fc_, which round out the country's top four papers, are all headquartered\nin Istanbul, boasting more than 300,000 weekly sales each. _H\u00fcrriyet'_s\nEnglish-language edition, _The H\u00fcrriyet Daily News_, has been printed since\n1961, but the English-language _Today's Zaman_, first published by _Zaman_ in\n2007, has overtaken it in circulation.

Control of\nthis transmission, and other radio stations established in the following\ndecades, ultimately came under the state-run Turkish Radio and Television\nCorporation (TRT), which held a monopoly on radio and television broadcasts\nbetween its founding in 1964 and 1990.[270] Today, TRT runs four national\nradio stations; these stations have transmitters across the country so each\ncan reach over 90 percent of the country's population, but only Radio 2 is\nbased in Istanbul. Offering a range of content from educational programming to\ncoverage of sporting events, Radio 2 is the most popular radio station in\nTurkey.[270] Istanbul's airwaves are the busiest in Turkey, primarily\nfeaturing either Turkish-language or English-language content. One of the\nexceptions, offering both, is A\u00e7\u0131k Radyo (94.9 FM). Among Turkey's first\nprivate stations, and the first featuring foreign popular music, was\nIstanbul's Metro FM (97.2 FM). The state-run Radio 3, although based in\nAnkara, also features English-language popular music, and English-language\nnews programming is provided on NTV Radyo (102.8 FM).[271]\n\nTRT-Children is the only TRT television station based in Istanbul.[272]\nIstanbul is home to the headquarters of several Turkish stations and regional\nheadquarters of international media outlets. Istanbul-based Star TV was the\nfirst private television network to be established following the end of the\nTRT monopoly; Star TV and Show TV (also based in Istanbul) remain highly\npopular throughout the country, airing Turkish and American series.[273]\nSamanyolu TV, Kanal D, and ATV are other stations in Istanbul that offer a mix\nof news and series; NTV (partnered with U.S. media outlet MSNBC) and Sky\nTurk\u2014both based in the city\u2014are mainly just known for their news coverage in\nTurkish. The BBC has a regional office in Istanbul, assisting its Turkish-\nlanguage news operations, and the American news channel CNN established the\nTurkish-language CNN T\u00fcrk there in 1999.[274] The Istanbul-based business and\nentertainment channel CNBC-e began broadcasting in 2000.\n\n## Education[edit]\n\nFurther information: Education in Turkey\n\n![A triumphal arch adjacent to a Turkish flag and in front of an open plaza](/\n/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Istanbul_University_cropped\n.JPG/170px-Istanbul_University_cropped.JPG)\n\nMain entrance gate of Istanbul University, the city's oldest Turkish\ninstitution, established in 1453.\n\nIstanbul University, founded in 1453, is the oldest Turkish educational\ninstitution in the city.

In recent years, Istanbul's\neducational system has expanded substantially; from 2000 to 2007, the number\nof classrooms and teachers nearly doubled and the number of students increased\nby more than 60 percent.[285] Galatasaray High School, established in 1481 as\nthe Galata Palace Imperial School, is the oldest high school in Istanbul and\nthe second-oldest educational institution in the city. It was built at the\nbehest of Sultan Bayezid II, who sought to bring students with diverse\nbackgrounds together as a means of strengthening his growing empire.[286] It\nis one of Turkey's Anatolian High Schools, elite public high schools that\nplace a stronger emphasis on instruction in foreign languages. Galatasaray,\nfor example, offers instruction in French; other Anatolian High Schools\nprimarily teach in English or German alongside Turkish.[287][288] The city\nalso has foreign high schools, such as Liceo Italiano, that were established\nin the 19th century to educate foreigners.[289]\n\nKuleli Military High School, along the shores of the Bosphorus in \u00c7engelk\u00f6y,\nand Turkish Naval High School, located on one of the Princes' Islands, are\nmilitary high schools, complemented by three military academies\u2014the Turkish\nAir Force, Turkish Military, and Turkish Naval Academies.

By 1876, the first international mailing network between Istanbul and\nthe lands beyond the Ottoman Empire had been established.[299] Sultan\nAbd\u00fclmecid I issued Samuel Morse his first official honor for the telegraph in\n1847, and construction of the first telegraph line\u2014between Istanbul and\nEdirne\u2014finished in time to announce the end of the Crimean War in 1856.[300] A\nnascent telephone system began to emerge in Istanbul in 1881 and after the\nfirst manual telephone exchange became operational in Istanbul in 1909, the\nMinistry of Post and Telegraph became the Ministry of Post, Telegraph, and\nTelephone.[299][301] GSM cellular networks arrived in Turkey in 1994, with\nIstanbul among the first cities to receive the service.[302] Today, mobile and\nlandline service is provided by private companies, after T\u00fcrk Telekom, which\nsplit from the Ministry of Post, Telegraph, and Telephone in 1995, was\nprivatized in 2005.[299][302] Postal services remain under the purview of what\nis now the Post and Telegraph Organization (retaining the acronym PTT).[299]\n\nIn 2000, Istanbul had 137 hospitals, of which 100 were private.[303] Turkish\ncitizens are entitled to subsidized healthcare in the nation's state-run\nhospitals.[268] As public hospitals tend to be overcrowded or otherwise slow,\nprivate hospitals are preferable for those who can afford them. Their\nprevalence has increased significantly over the last decade, as the percentage\nof outpatients using private hospitals increased from 6 percent to 23 percent\nbetween 2005 and 2009.[268][304] Many of these private hospitals, as well as\nsome of the public hospitals, are equipped with high-tech equipment, including\nMRI machines, or associated with medical research centers.[305] Turkey has\nmore hospitals accredited by the U.S.-based Joint Commission than any other\ncountry in the world, with most concentrated in its big cities. The high\nquality of healthcare, especially in private hospitals, has contributed to a\nrecent upsurge in medical tourism to Turkey (with a 40 percent increase\nbetween 2007 and 2008).[306] Laser eye surgery is particularly common among\nmedical tourists, as Turkey is known for specializing in the procedure.[307]\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\nMain article: Public transport in Istanbul\n\n![A docked sailboat floats in front of a suspension bridge, at twilight.](//up\nload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Fatih_Sultan_Mehmet_Bridge_pan\norama.jpg/220px-Fatih_Sultan_Mehmet_Bridge_panorama.jpg)\n\nThe Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge is one of two suspension bridges on the\nBosphorus. The third bridge (Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge) is under construction\nnear the strait's northern entrance along the Black Sea coast.\n\nIstanbul's primary motorways are the O-1, O-2, O-3 and O-4. The O-1 forms the\ncity's inner ring road, traversing the Bosphorus Bridge, and the O-2 is the\ncity's outer ring road, crossing the Fatih Sultan Mehmet (Second Bosphorus)\nBridge. The O-2 continues west to Edirne and the O-4 continues east to Ankara;\nthe O-2, O-3, and O-4 are part of European route E80 (the Trans-European\nMotorway) between Portugal and the Turkish\u2013Iranian border.[308] The two\nBosphorus Bridges are currently the only road crossings between the Asian and\nEuropean sides of Turkey, together carrying 400,000 vehicles each day.[309]\nThe dual-deck, 14.6-kilometer (9.1\u00a0mi) Eurasia Tunnel is currently under\nconstruction beneath the Bosphorus, between Fatih and \u00dcsk\u00fcdar.[310] A third\nBosphorus bridge, first considered in the 1990s, may also finally be coming to\nfruition, as construction of the Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge was officially\nlaunched in 2013.[311] Both projects may be completed as early as 2015,\nalthough environmentalist groups worry that the third bridge will endanger the\nremaining green areas to the north of Istanbul.[310][311]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/T%C3%BCrkiye_%C4%B0sta\nnbul_nostalji_iki_tramvay_kar%C5%9F%C4%B1la%C5%9Fmas%C4%B1.jpg/200px-T%C3%BCrk\niye_%C4%B0stanbul_nostalji_iki_tramvay_kar%C5%9F%C4%B1la%C5%9Fmas%C4%B1.jpg)\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Istanbul_T1_line_Alsto\nm_Citadis_tram.jpg/200px-Istanbul_T1_line_Alstom_Citadis_tram.jpg)\n\nIstanbul's nostalgic and modern tram systems.\n\nIstanbul's local public transportation system is a complex network of trams,\nfuniculars, metro lines, buses, bus rapid transit, and ferries. Fares across\nmodes are integrated, using the contactless Istanbulkart, introduced in 2009,\nor the older Akbil electronic ticket device.[312] Trams in Istanbul date back\nto 1872, when they were horse-drawn, but even the first electrified trams were\ndecommissioned in the 1960s.[313] Operated by Istanbul Electricity, Tramway,\nand Tunnel General Management (\u0130ETT), trams slowly returned to the city in the\n1990s with the introduction of a nostalgic route and a faster modern tram\nline, which now carries 265,000 passengers each day.[313][314] The T\u00fcnel\nopened in 1875 as the world's second-oldest subterranean rail line (after\nLondon's Metropolitan Railway).[313] It still carries passengers between\nKarak\u00f6y and \u0130stiklal Avenue along a steep 573-meter (1,880\u00a0ft) track; a more\nmodern funicular between Taksim Square and Kabata\u015f began running in\n2006.[315][316]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/%C4%B0stanbul_metrosu0\n0020.JPG/220px-%C4%B0stanbul_metrosu00020.JPG)\n\nLevent station of the Istanbul Metro\n\nThe Istanbul Metro comprises three lines (the M1 and M2 on the European side,\nand the M4 on the Asian side) with several other lines (such as the M3, M5,\nM7, and M6 Mini-Metro) and extensions under construction.[317][318] The two\nsides of Istanbul's metro are connected under the Bosphorus by the Marmaray\ntunnel, inaugurated in 2013 as the first rail connection between Thrace and\nAnatolia.[319] With the Marmaray's completion, rail use in the city is\nexpected to increase to 28 percent (from 4 percent), behind only Tokyo and New\nYork City.[320] Until then, buses provide transportation within and between\nthe two halves of the city, accommodating 2.2 million passenger trips each\nday.[321] The Metrobus, a form of bus rapid transit, crosses the Bosphorus\nBridge, with dedicated lanes leading to its termini.[322] \u0130DO (Istanbul\nSeabuses) runs a combination of all-passenger ferries and car-and-passenger\nferries to ports on both sides of the Bosphorus, as far north as the Black\nSea.[323][324] With additional destinations around the Sea of Marmara, \u0130DO\nruns the largest municipal ferry operation in the world.[325] The city's main\ncruise ship terminal is the Port of Istanbul in Karak\u00f6y, with a capacity of\n10,000 passengers per hour.[326] Most visitors enter Istanbul by air, but\nabout half a million foreign tourists enter the city by sea each year.[219]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Bahnhofsfront-\nIstanbul-Sirkeci_retouched.jpg/220px-Bahnhofsfront-Istanbul-\nSirkeci_retouched.jpg)\n\nOriginally opened in 1873 with a smaller terminal building as the main\nterminus of the Rumelia (Balkan) Railway of the Ottoman Empire, which\nconnected Istanbul with Vienna; the current Sirkeci Terminal building was\nconstructed between 1888 and 1890, and became the eastern terminus of the\nOrient Express from Paris.\n\nInternational rail service from Istanbul launched in 1889, with a line between\nBucharest and Istanbul's Sirkeci Terminal, which ultimately became famous as\nthe eastern terminus of the Orient Express from Paris.[83] Regular service to\nBucharest and Thessaloniki continued until the early 2010s, when the former\nwas interrupted for Marmaray construction and the latter was halted due to\neconomic problems in Greece.[327][328] After Istanbul's Haydarpa\u015fa Terminal\nopened in 1908, it served as the western terminus of the Baghdad Railway and\nan extension of the Hejaz Railway; today, neither service is offered directly\nfrom Istanbul.[329][330][331] Service to Ankara and other points across Turkey\nis normally offered by Turkish State Railways, but the construction of\nMarmaray and the Ankara-Istanbul high-speed line forced the station to close\nin 2012.[332] New stations to replace both the Haydarpa\u015fa and Sirkeci\nterminals, and connect the city's disjointed railway networks, are expected to\nopen upon completion of the Marmaray project; until then, Istanbul is without\nintercity rail service.[332] Private bus companies operate instead. Istanbul's\nmain bus station is the largest in Europe, with a daily capacity of 15,000\nbuses and 600,000 passengers, serving destinations as distant as\nFrankfurt.[333][334]\n\n![An aerial view of an airport with three runways and several taxiways\narranged around a terminal](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4\n6/Ataturk_Airport_overview_Karakas.jpg/220px-\nAtaturk_Airport_overview_Karakas.jpg)\n\nIstanbul Atat\u00fcrk Airport, which handled 51.2 million passengers in 2013,[335]\nis the city's primary airport.\n\nIstanbul has two international airports. The larger is Istanbul Atat\u00fcrk, 24\nkilometers (15\u00a0mi) west of the city center. It handled 51.2 million passengers\nin 2013, making it the fifth-busiest airport in Europe and the eighteenth-\nbusiest in the world.[335] Sabiha G\u00f6k\u00e7en International, 45 kilometers (28\u00a0mi)\nsoutheast of the city center, opened in 2001 to relieve Atat\u00fcrk. Dominated by\nlow-cost carriers, Istanbul's second airport has rapidly become popular,\nespecially since the opening of a new international terminal in 2009;[336] the\nairport handled 14.7 million passengers in 2012, a year after Airports Council\nInternational named it the world's fastest-growing airport.[337][338] Atat\u00fcrk\nhas also experienced rapid growth, as its 20.6 percent rise in passenger\ntraffic between 2011 and 2012 was the highest among the world's top 30\nairports.[335] Because of the traffic at Istanbul's current airports,[339] a\nthird international airport is planned for the Black Sea coast.[340] Building\na new runway at Atat\u00fcrk Airport was rejected due to the cost involved;[339]\nenvironmental concerns have also been raised with respect to the new\nairport.[341] Currently under construction, the new international airport will\nbecome the largest airport in the world upon the completion of all four stages\nof the project, with a capacity to serve 150 million passengers per\nyear.[342][343][344]\n\n## Sister and twin cities[edit]\n\n  * List of twin and sister cities of Istanbul\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Historic Areas of Istanbul, a World Heritage Site\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ _**a**_ _**b**_ The foundation of Byzantion (Byzantium) is sometimes, especially in encyclopedic or other tertiary sources, placed firmly in 667 BCE. Historians have disputed the precise year the city was founded. Commonly cited is the work of 5th-century-BC historian Herodotus, which says the city was founded seventeen years after Chalcedon,[44] which came into existence around 685 BCE. Eusebius concurs with 685 BCE as the year Chalcedon was founded, but places Byzantion's establishment in 659 BCE.[45] Among more modern historians, Carl Roebuck proposed the 640s BCE[46] and others have suggested even later. The foundation date of Chalcedon is itself subject to some debate; while many sources place it in 685 BC,[47] others put it in 675 BC[48] or even 639 BCE (with Byzantion's establishment placed in 619 BCE).[45] Some sources refer to Byzantium's foundation as the 7th century BCE.\n  2. **^** The name _Istanbul_ has been in use since before the 1453 Ottoman conquest, but in English _Istanbul_ became common only after Turkey adapted the Latin alphabet in 1928 and urged other countries to use the city's Turkish name.[1]\n  3. ^ _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ Sources have provided conflicting figures on the area of Istanbul. The most authoritative source on this figure ought to be the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (MMI), but the English version of its website suggests a few figures for this area. One page states that \"Each MM is sub-divided into District Municipalities (\"DM\") _of which there are 27 in Istanbul_\" [emphasis added] with a total area of 1,538.9 square kilometers (594.2\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[91] The Municipal History page appears to be the most explicit and most updated, saying that in 2004, \"Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality's jurisdiction was enlarged to cover all the area within the provincial limits\". It also states a 2008 law merged the Emin\u00f6n\u00fc district into the Fatih district (a point that is not reflected in the previous source) and increased the number of districts in Istanbul to 39.[92] That total area, as corroborated on the Turkish version of the MMI website,[93] and a Jurisdiction page on the English site[94] is 5,343 square kilometers (2,063\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).\n  4. ^ _**a**_ _**b**_ Historians disagree\u2014sometimes substantially\u2014on population figures of Istanbul (Constantinople), and other world cities, prior to the 20th century. A follow-up to Chandler &amp; Fox 1974,Chandler 1987, pp.\u00a0463\u2013505[80] examines different sources' estimates and chooses the most likely based on historical conditions; it is the source of most population figures between 100 and 1914. The ranges of values between 500 and 1000 are due to Morris 2010, which also does a comprehensive analysis of sources, including Chandler (1987); Morris notes that many of Chandler's estimates during that time seem too large for the city's size, and presents smaller estimates. Chandler disagrees with Turan 2010 on the population of the city in the mid-1920s (with the former suggesting 817,000 in 1925), but Turan, p. 224, is used as the source of population figures between 1924 and 2005. Turan's figures, as well as the 2010 figure,[160] come from the Turkish Statistical Institute. The drastic increase in population between 1980 and 1985 is largely due to an enlargement of the city's limits (see the Administration section). Explanations for population changes in pre-Republic times can be inferred from the History section.\n  5. **^** The United Nations defines an urban agglomeration as \"the population contained within the contours of a contiguous territory inhabited at urban density levels without regard to administrative boundaries\". The agglomeration \"usually incorporates the population in a city or town plus that in the suburban areas lying outside of, but being adjacent to, the city boundaries\".[166] Figures dated 1 July 2011 place the populations of the agglomerations of Moscow and Istanbul at 11.62 million and 11.25 million, respectively.[167] The UN estimates that the agglomeration of Istanbul will exceed the agglomeration of Moscow in population by 2015 (with 12.46 million and 12.14 million, respectively), although extrapolation suggests that the former will not surpass latter until the second half of 2013. A revision with 2013 data is due in the first half of 2014.[_needs update_][166]\n  6. **^** UEFA does not apparently keep a list of Category 4 stadiums, but regulations stipulate that only these elite stadiums are eligible to host UEFA Champions League Finals,[253] which Atat\u00fcrk Olympic Stadium did in 2005, and UEFA Europa League (formerly UEFA Cup) Finals,[254] which \u015e\u00fckr\u00fc Saraco\u011flu Stadium did in 2009. T\u00fcrk Telekom Arena is noted as an elite UEFA stadium by its architects.[255]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ _**d**_ _**e**_ Room 2006, pp.\u00a0177\n  2. **^** \"City mayors:Largest cities in the world by land area, population and density\". _citymayors.com_.

The United States boycotted the Moscow\nOlympics in protest against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and, as of\n2015, the Australian victory remains the only occasion the United States has\nnot won the event at Olympic level since its inception in 1960. The quartet\nconsisted of backstroker Mark Kerry, breaststroker Peter Evans, butterflyer\nMark Tonelli and freestyler Neil Brooks. The team was nominally led by its\noldest member Tonelli, who was 23 and was also a spokesperson for the\nAustralian athletes' campaign for their right to compete at the Olympics\nagainst the wishes of the Fraser Government. The team was seen as an unlikely\nprospect to win; all four of the swimmers had clashed with swimming\nauthorities over disciplinary issues and three experienced suspension or\nexpulsion from the Australian team during their careers.\n\nAustralia had previously won medals in the event, but was not regarded as one\nof the favourites for the gold, as the Soviet Union, Great Britain, and Sweden\nall fielded more decorated swimmers over the component legs of the relay.\nAfter the backstroke leg, Australia was in fourth place and more than a second\nin arrears of the Soviet leaders. However, Evans was the fastest among the\nbreaststrokers and moved the team into second position at the halfway point in\nthe race; and Tonelli, a makeshift butterflyer, completed his leg in a time\nmuch faster than his previous best, allowing Australia to keep the Soviet lead\nreasonable. Australia's anchor swimmer Brooks overtook his more credentialled\nSoviet counterpart Sergey Kopliakov in the latter half of the final leg to\nsecure a narrow victory. The quartet disbanded after the Olympics due to\nTonelli's retirement, although some of the members continued to be present in\nthe relay team at various times alongside new swimmers. By 1986, all four\nmembers of the 1980 team had retired from international competition.\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Personnel\n  * 2 Event history and expectations\n  * 3 Race\n  * 4 Government reaction\n  * 5 Aftermath\n  * 6 Notes\n  * 7 References\n  * 8 External links\n\n## Personnel[edit]\n\nMain articles: Mark Tonelli, Mark Kerry, Peter Evans and Neil Brooks\n\nThe Australian team for the event was a young and inexperienced foursome. Mark\nTonelli was the oldest at the age of 23, followed by Mark Kerry, who turned 21\na month after the Olympics. Both were attending their second Olympics, while\nPeter Evans and Neil Brooks were 18 and 17 respectively and had never\nrepresented Australia at the Commonwealth, World Championship or Olympic\nlevel. Evans and Brooks were from Western Australia, a state that had never\nbeen prominent in Australian swimming. The team members had some contact prior\nto their Olympic selection; Brooks' family had billeted Tonelli in 1976 when\nthe Australian Olympic team held a training camp in Perth. Brooks cited his\nexperience with Tonelli as a motivating factor in his career.[1]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/MalcolmFraser1982.JPEG\n/220px-MalcolmFraser1982.JPEG)\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser (pictured) pressured the Australian\nathletes to boycott the Olympics.\n\nThe quartet was also marked by rebellious and anti-establishment tendencies.\nTonelli and Kerry were expelled from the 1978 Commonwealth Games team by the\nAustralian Swimming Union for violating a curfew during a training camp in\nHawaii before the team's trip to Edmonton, Canada for the competition;[2]\nTonelli had been out drinking and admitted to smoking marijuana, which was not\nillegal in Hawaii, while Kerry had been courting a female.[3] In 1980, during\nthe lead-up to the selection of the Olympic team, Brooks walked out of a\ntraining camp, alleging that the coaches were neglecting him, while Evans once\nstopped during a training session and refused to do extra mileage,\nemphatically proclaiming that \"work is a poor substitute for talent\".[4] Later\nin their careers, Evans and Brooks continued to have their clashes with\nswimming officialdom; Evans over his coaches' demands for more training\nmileage and Brooks over swimmers' human rights.[4] Brooks was later suspended\ntwice in his career for his clashes with swimming authorities,[5] and expelled\nfrom the Australian Institute of Sport for indiscipline.[6]\n\nThe rebel qualities of the group were on show in the lead up to the Olympics.\nAn obstacle arose with the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, which resulted\nin a boycott of the Games by a large part of the Western world, led by the\nUnited States. The Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser was also the\npatron of the Australian Olympic Committee, and he and sections of the public\nput significant political pressure on the athletes to join the boycott.\nTonelli realised that only the sportspeople would suffer from a boycott and\nthat trade relations would continue unabated. He took a leadership role among\nthe athletes, fighting for their right to compete and publicising their cause\nto the Australian community.[7][8][9] Evans was fully supportive of Tonelli's\ncampaign, reflecting that \"We were political tools, and the only ones to\nsuffer would be us.\"[10] He rhetorically asked: \"Do you really think that if\nwe didn't go someone would come up to us after the Games and pat us on the\nback for not going?\"[11]\n\nKerry was equally adamant that he was going to compete, unlike some swimmers\nwho decided to make personal boycotts. He received offers from Australian\nofficials to not compete in return for financial payments. He said\n\n> I felt the biggest statement we could make was to go to Moscow and show the\nworld. If there was a total boycott, fine, but trade was still going on. It\nwas disgusting. Why should the athletes be made to suffer?[12]\n\nAccording to women's swimming captain Lisa Forrest,[13] Tonelli adopted\npopulist tactics in championing the athletes' cause. He said that Fraser was\nsending \"wheat to feed the Russian army, wool to clothe the army and\nAustralian metal to make Russian guns\",[14] claiming that this contradicted\nthe proposed protest against the invasion and Russian military aggression.[14]\nTonelli's anti-authoritarian and individualistic style manifested itself\nduring media appearances,[15] including a news interview in which he debated\nwith Reverend Lance Shilton, who had called the athletes traitors.[15] Shilton\nexpressed sympathy for the athletes, which Tonelli interpreted as\ncondescension. He responded by rolling his eyes and twirling his finger, a\ngaffe that was shown on national television;[15] Tonelli mistakenly thought\nthat only his voice was being broadcast at the time and that the images were\nshowing something else. Forrest said that \"the damage was done\u2014one of our most\nprominent anti-boycott lobbyists ... looked like a smart alec\".[15]\n\n## Event history and expectations[edit]\n\nSee also: Swimming at the 1980 Summer Olympics\n\nThe United States had always won the 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100\u00a0m medley relay since the event's\ninception at the Olympics in 1960 with comfortable margins. The closest\nwinning buffer was 2.6\u00a0seconds and in 1972 and 1976 they had won by 4.10 and\n3.72\u00a0s respectively;[16][17][18][19][20] their boycott opened up the field in\nthe event.[4] In the five previous times the event had been contested,\nAustralia's best result had come in the inaugural race in Rome, where the team\nof David Theile, Terry Gathercole, Neville Hayes and Geoff Shipton out-touched\nJapan to claim silver. The only other time that Australia had won a medal was\nin Tokyo in 1964, when Peter Reynolds, Ian O'Brien, Kevin Berry and David\nDickson finished behind the United States and Germany. The following two Games\nsaw a fourth placing and an elimination in the heats. The previous outing in\n1976 in Montreal had seen Australia come sixth.[4] Kerry was the only veteran\nof the 1976 relay team who returned to the Olympics in Moscow.[21]\n\nAustralia was regarded by swimming analysts as a medal chance, but were not\nseen as the main threats\u2014Sweden, Great Britain and the Soviet Union were the\nmost heavily fancied teams.[4] The hosts had the silver medallists in the 100\nm backstroke and breaststroke, Viktor Kuznetsov and Arsens Miskarovs\nrespectively, and their butterflyer Yevgeny Seredin had come fifth in his 100\nm event. Their freestyler Sergey Kopliakov later came fourth in the\ncorresponding 100\u00a0m event. The British boasted Duncan Goodhew, the 100\u00a0m\nbreaststroke gold medallist, and Gary Abraham, who had placed fifth in the 100\nm backstroke. Sweden's butterflyer P\u00e4r Arvidsson and backstroker Bengt Baron\nhad won their respective 100\u00a0m events and their freestyle swimmer Per Holmertz\nwould win silver in the 100\u00a0m a few days later.[22] Their weakest swimmer was\nthe breaststroker Peter Berggren, who came ninth in the 100\u00a0m.[23] On paper,\nAustralia's team paled in comparison. Brooks later came seventh in his 100\u00a0m\nfreestyle semifinal and 14th overall after having an asthma attack,[24][25]\nand Evans was Australia's only medallist in the corresponding individual\nevent, winning bronze in the breaststroke.[26] Kerry had been eliminated in\nthe 100\u00a0m backstroke semifinals, while Tonelli was the Australian champion in\nthe 100\u00a0m freestyle and backstroke but was swimming as a makeshift\nbutterflyer; the nation did not have an entrant in the 100\u00a0m butterfly.[4][9]\nAdding to the pressure was Australia's failure to win any gold medals in any\nsport at the 1976 Olympics. This meant that the public were still awaiting\ntheir first gold since the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich.[27] Coming into the\nOlympics, Australia was ranked seventh out of the thirteen competing\ncountries.[28]\n\n## Race[edit]\n\nMain article: Swimming at the 1980 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 4 \u00d7 100 metre\nmedley relay\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5c/Quietly_Confident_Quartet.j\npg/200px-Quietly_Confident_Quartet.jpg)\n\nThe \"Quietly Confident Quartet\" pictured after the team's win at the 1980\nMoscow Olympics: from left, Peter Evans, Neil Brooks, Mark Tonelli, and Mark\nKerry.\n\nThe medley relay was scheduled for Thursday, 24 July, the fifth day of\nswimming competition, with heats in the morning and the final in the evening.\nAustralia's prospects improved when Sweden was disqualified in the first\nheat.[4] Australia and the Soviet Union swam in the second heat. With their\nsuperior depth, the home team was able to rest their entire first-choice\nquartet in the heats. On the other hand, Australia was only willing to rest\nKerry\u2014Glenn Patching swam the backstroke leg in his place.[29] The hosts led\nthe Australians from the start and extended their margin over each of the\nfirst three legs. Brooks reclaimed 1.34\u00a0s on the freestyle leg, but the\nAustralians fell 0.13\u00a0s short to come second in their heat. Nevertheless, the\nAustralians still qualified in second place overall, as they and the Soviets\nwere more than 1.5\u00a0s faster than the third-placed Hungarians. In any case,\ndespite resting all of their first-choice quartet, the home team were still\nfaster than the Australians, who had fielded all but one of their full-\nstrength team.[29]\n\nEvans brashly took the opportunity to attempt to regain the psychological\nascendancy from Goodhew, confronting him privately and stating that \"we will\nwin it\", later reporting that the Briton was astounded by his posturing.[11]\nThe eldest swimmer in the quartet at the age of 23, Tonelli convened the team\nas its _de facto_ leader. He asked his compatriots to commit to swimming their\nlegs in a certain time; Kerry vowed to swim the backstroke in 57\u00a0s, Evans the\nbreaststroke in 63\u00a0s flat, Tonelli the butterfly in 54\u00a0s and Brooks promised\nto anchor the team in 49.8\u00a0s, even though he had never gone faster than 51\u00a0s.\nTonelli named the foursome the \"Quietly Confident Quartet\" because they\nexhibited a reserved self-belief as they lined up for the race. Whereas most\nof the other teams were \"psyching up\" in the marshalling area, the Australians\nwere remaining light-hearted and placid, confident that they could perform in\nthe water.[4][9]\n\nPatching was one of several backstrokers who had slipped on the starting area\nearlier in the meet, so Kerry decided to rub a sticky red substance onto the\nsoles of his feet. The Soviet organisers had provided a carpet following the\nincidents, resulting in Kerry leaving red footprints in the stadium.[11] Kerry\nled off in a time faster than his effort in the individual event, but it was\nstill two seconds slower than his personal best. He finished his leg in 57.87\ns, leaving Australia in fourth place.[4] Kuznetsov gave the Soviets the lead\nafter posting a time of 56.81\u00a0s, with Hungary and Great Britain in second and\nthird place. France was the last to reach the 100\u00a0m mark, recording a time of\n58.84\u00a0s.[29] Evans then swam a personal best of 63.01\u00a0s, the fastest split\namong the breaststrokers by 0.63\u00a0s. His leg moved Australia into second place\nat the halfway mark, just 0.45\u00a0s behind the hosts and roughly half a second\nahead of the British and the Hungarians. The four leading teams had broken\naway, leaving a two-second gap back to the fifth-placed East\nGermans.[4][11][29]\n\nTonelli then swam his leg in 54.94\u00a0s, almost two seconds faster than his\nprevious best over the distance.[4] He began to lose ground in the last 50\u00a0m\nand was a bodylength behind Seredin until a late surge brought him to within a\nmetre by the time the swimmers touched the wall.[4] If Tonelli had replicated\nhis relay leg in the individual event, he would have claimed the silver\nmedal.[8] Although he lost 0.36\u00a0s to Seredin, he had minimised his loss and\nAustralia were within 0.81\u00a0s going into the final leg. Furthermore, the\nAustralians were now more than a second clear of the third placed Great\nBritain.[29]\n\nBrooks then executed a powerful, well-timed dive and surfaced almost even with\nhis Soviet counterpart Kopliakov. He had drawn level halfway through his leg\nand made a superior turn to take the lead as they headed home. The Soviet\nfreestyler pulled level with 25\u00a0m to go before Brooks again pulled away to\nseal an Australian victory by 0.22\u00a0s.[4] He did not breathe in the last ten\nmetres, and claimed to be laughing for the final five metres, confident that\nhis opponent could not pass him.[30] Brooks had finished his leg in 49.86\u00a0s as\nhe had vowed to his team mates.[24] In doing so, he recorded the swiftest\nfreestyle split in the relay, faster than that of the individual 100\u00a0m\nfreestyle gold medallist, J\u00f6rg Woithe of East Germany.[29]\n\nThe time of 3\u00a0m 45.70\u00a0s sealed Australia's first win in a medley relay at the\nOlympics, for men or women. It remains the only time that the United States\nhas not won the men's event.[4] The team made a celebratory dive into the\nwater and did a poolside interview.[11] Tonelli remarked that \"I was totally\nstunned. After all the hassle, and my being the athletes' mouthpiece, we'd\ncome through and done it\".[8][9][31] Forrest hailed the win as \"a gold medal\nthat should never have been\".[28]\n\nSportscaster Norman May's dramatic call of the race on the 2UE radio network,\nending with \"Gold, gold for Australia, gold!\", became one of Australia's best-\nknown and most iconic sports commentaries.[32]\n\n## Government reaction[edit]\n\nRelations between the Olympians and the Australian Government remained tense\nafter months of political struggle regarding the boycott. A prime minister\nwould customarily send a congratulatory message to Olympic medallists.[33]\nHowever, the Australian Olympic chef de mission Phil Coles confirmed at the\nfollowing day's press conference that the quartet had not received a message\nfrom Fraser. Australian journalists soon bombarded Fraser's office with phone\ncalls asking why he had not applauded the athletes. Various members of the\ngovernment recommended that Fraser congratulate the swimmers, but the prime\nminister baulked. When questioned in a radio interview, he said \"I hope that\ncircumstances do not arise over the next few years which will cause them to\nhave very great regrets about the fact that they've gone\".[33] Fraser relented\nand late in the night, his office sent a telegram.[33][34] However, he would\nnot send his message directly to the Olympic village, so the telegram was sent\nto the Australian Embassy in Moscow.[33] Fraser had ordered the Australian\ndiplomatic mission to close its doors to the Olympians,[35] so the embassy\nstaff had to pass the envelopes containing the message through the fence to\nAustralian Olympic officials. Fraser's telegram said:[36]\n\n> You know I did not and do not approve of Australia being represented at\nthese Olympic Games. I do want to say however that your performance in the\nrelay was a truly great sporting achievement. My personal congratulations.[36]\n\nColes reported that the relay squad tore up the prime minister's message.[36]\n\n## Aftermath[edit]\n\nThe quartet never competed as a unit after the Moscow Olympics. Tonelli\nretired immediately after the Games,[31] while Kerry took an extended break.\nThe backstroker attempted a comeback in the leadup to the 1982 Commonwealth\nGames in Brisbane, but his abbreviated preparation before the selection trials\nwas not enough and he was defeated by other swimmers.[12] This left Evans and\nBrooks as the only members of the 1980 team to participate in Australia's\nmedley relay victory at the Commonwealth Games.[37] In 1984, Kerry secured a\nrecall to the team as Australia's preferred backstroker,[12] while Brooks was\nsurpassed by Mark Stockwell as the leading freestyler.[5] Australia came third\nin the 1984 Summer Olympics in the medley relay as the Americans returned to\nthe Olympic fold; Evans and Kerry swam in the final, while Brooks did the\nfreestyle leg in the heats.[37] Evans and Kerry retired after the\nOlympics,[12][37] and Brooks was not the first-choice swimmer in 1986, meaning\nthat a totally different quartet competed in the medley relay at the 1986\nCommonwealth Games in Edinburgh. Brooks was suspended for drunken behaviour on\nthe flight back to Australia, and then retired, and all four members of the\nQuietly Confident Quartet had departed the Australian swimming scene.[38]\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n  1. **^** Howell, p. 244.\n  2. **^** Forrest, p. 85.\n  3. **^** Tonelli, pp. 83\u201386.\n  4. ^ _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ _**d**_ _**e**_ _**f**_ _**g**_ _**h**_ _**i**_ _**j**_ _**k**_ _**l**_ _**m**_ _**n**_ Howell, p. 234.\n  5. ^ _**a**_ _**b**_ Howell, p. 246.\n  6. **^** Talbot, Heads and Berry, p. 124.\n  7. **^** Howell, p. 239.\n  8. ^ _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ Andrews, pp. 440\u2013441.\n  9. ^ _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ _**d**_ Gordon, p. 334.\n  10. **^** Howell, p. 241.\n  11. ^ _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ _**d**_ _**e**_ Howell, p. 242.\n  12. ^ _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ _**d**_ Howell, p. 237.\n  13. **^** Forrest, p. xiv.\n  14. ^ _**a**_ _**b**_ Forrest, p. 43.\n  15. ^ _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ _**d**_ Forrest, pp. 163\u2013164.\n  16. **^** \"Swimming at the 1960 Roma Summer Games: Men's 4 \u00d7 100 metres Medley Relay\".

Shot in black-and-white, _Eraserhead_ is\nLynch's first feature-length film, coming after several short works. The film\nwas produced with the assistance of the American Film Institute (AFI) during\nthe director's time studying there. Starring Jack Nance, Charlotte Stewart,\nJeanne Bates, Judith Anna Roberts, Laurel Near, and Jack Fisk, it tells the\nstory of Henry Spencer (Nance), who is left to care for his grossly deformed\nchild in a desolate industrial landscape. Throughout the film, Spencer\nexperiences dreams or hallucinations, featuring his child and the Lady in the\nRadiator (Near).\n\n_Eraserhead_ spent several years in principal photography because of the\ndifficulty of funding the film; donations from Fisk and his wife Sissy Spacek\nkept production afloat. The film was shot on several locations owned by the\nAFI in California, including Greystone Mansion and a set of disused stables in\nwhich Lynch lived. Lynch and sound designer Alan Splet spent a year working on\nthe film's audio after their studio was soundproofed. The film's soundtrack\nfeatures organ music by Fats Waller and includes the song \"In Heaven\", penned\nfor the film by Peter Ivers.\n\nInitially opening to small audiences and little interest, _Eraserhead_ gained\npopularity over several long runs as a midnight movie. Since its release, the\nfilm has earned positive reviews. The surrealist imagery and sexual\nundercurrents have been seen as key thematic elements, and the intricate sound\ndesign as its technical highlight. Thematic analysis of the film has also\nhighlighted these issues and has elaborated on Spencer's fatalism and\ninactivity. In 2004, the film was preserved in the National Film Registry by\nthe United States Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or\naesthetically significant\".\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Plot\n  * 2 Production\n    * 2.1 Pre-production\n    * 2.2 Filming\n    * 2.3 Post-production\n  * 3 Soundtrack\n  * 4 Themes\n  * 5 Release\n    * 5.1 Box office\n    * 5.2 Home media\n  * 6 Reception\n  * 7 Legacy\n  * 8 See also\n  * 9 Footnotes\n    * 9.1 References\n  * 10 External links\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\nThe Man in the Planet (Jack Fisk) pulls levers in his home in space, while the\nhead of Henry Spencer (Jack Nance) floats in the sky. A giant spermatozoon-\nlike creature emerges from Spencer's mouth, floating into the void. The Man in\nthe Planet appears to control the creature with his levers, eventually making\nit fall into a pool of water.\n\nIn an industrial cityscape, Spencer walks home with his groceries. He is\nstopped outside his apartment by the Beautiful Girl Across the Hall (Judith\nAnna Roberts), who informs him that his girlfriend, Mary X (Charlotte\nStewart), has invited him to dinner with her family. Spencer leaves his\ngroceries in his apartment, which is filled with piles of dirt and dead\nvegetation. That night, Spencer visits X's home, conversing awkwardly with her\nmother (Jeanne Bates). At the dinner table, he is asked to carve a chicken\nthat X's talkative father, Bill (Allen Joseph) has \"made\"; the bird writhes on\nthe plate and gushes blood. After dinner, Spencer is cornered by X's mother,\nwho tries to kiss him. She tells him that X has had his child and that the two\nmust marry. X, however, is not sure if what she bore is a child.\n\nThe couple move into Spencer's one-room apartment and begin caring for the\nchild\u2014a swaddled bundle with an inhuman, snakelike face, resembling the\nspermatozoon-like creature. The infant refuses all food, crying incessantly\nand intolerably. The sound drives X hysterical, and she leaves Spencer and the\nchild. Spencer attempts to care for the child, and he learns that it struggles\nto breathe and has developed painful sores.\n\nSpencer begins experiencing visions, again seeing the Man in the Planet, as\nwell as the Lady in the Radiator (Laurel Near), who sings to him as she stomps\nupon spermatozoon-like creatures. After a sexual encounter with the Beautiful\nGirl Across the Hall, Spencer has a vision where he is decapitated by a\ncreature resembling the child, revealing a stump underneath that resembles the\nchild's face. Soon afterwards, Spencer's head sinks into a pool of blood and\nfalls from the sky, landing on a street below. A boy finds it, bringing it to\na pencil factory to be turned into erasers.\n\nSpencer seeks out the Beautiful Girl Across the Hall, but finds her with\nanother man. Crushed, Spencer returns to his room, where the child is crying.\nHe takes a pair of scissors and for the first time removes the child's\nswaddling. It is revealed that the child has no skin; the bandages held its\ninternal organs together, and they spill apart after the rags are cut. The\nchild gasps in pain, and Spencer cuts its organs with the scissors. The wounds\ngush a thick liquid, covering the child. The power in the room overloads; as\nthe lights flicker on and off the child grows to huge proportions. When the\nlights burn out completely, the child's head is replaced by the planet.\nSpencer appears amidst a billowing cloud of eraser shavings. The side of the\nplanet bursts apart, and inside, the Man in the Planet struggles with his\nlevers, which are now emitting sparks. Spencer is embraced warmly by the Lady\nin the Radiator, as both white light and white noise crescendo before all\nturns black and silent and the film suddenly ends.\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n### Pre-production[edit]\n\n![A black-and-white full-length picture of a man in a\nsuit](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Kafka1906.jpg/145px-\nKafka1906.jpg)\n\n![A painted portrait of a moustached man](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/com\nmons/thumb/e/ee/N.Gogol_by_F.Moller_%28early_1840s%2C_Ivanovo%29_detail.jpg/16\n8px-N.Gogol_by_F.Moller_%28early_1840s%2C_Ivanovo%29_detail.jpg)\n\nThe works of Franz Kafka _(left)_ and Nikolai Gogol _(right)_ influenced\n_Eraserhead_'s script.\n\nWriter and director David Lynch had previously studied for a career as an\nartist, and he had created several short films to animate his paintings.[3] By\n1970, however, he had switched his focus to film-making, and at the age of 24\nhe accepted a scholarship at the American Film Institute's Centre for Advanced\nFilm Studies. Lynch disliked the course and considered dropping out, but he\nchanged his mind after he was offered the chance to produce a script of his\nown devising. He was given permission to use the school's full campus for film\nsets; he converted the school's disused stables into a series of sets and\nlived there.[4] In addition, Greystone Mansion, also owned by the AFI, was\nused for many scenes.[5]\n\nLynch had initially begun work on a script titled _Gardenback_, based on his\npainting of a hunched figure with vegetation growing from its back.\n_Gardenback_ was a surrealist script about adultery, which featured a\ncontinually growing insect representing one man's lust for his neighbor. The\nscript would have resulted in a roughly 45-minute-long film, which the AFI\nfelt was too long for such a figurative, nonlinear script.[6] In its place,\nLynch presented _Eraserhead_, which he had developed based on a daydream of a\nman's head being taken to a pencil factory by a small boy. Several board\nmembers at the AFI were still opposed to producing such a surrealist work, but\nthey were persuaded when Dean Frank Daniel threatened to resign if it were to\nbe vetoed.[7] Lynch's script for _Eraserhead_ was influenced by his reading as\na film student; Franz Kafka's 1915 novella _The Metamorphosis_ and Nikolai\nGogol's 1836 short story \"The Nose\" were strong influences on the\nscreenplay.[8]\n\nThe script is also thought to have been inspired by Lynch's fear of\nfatherhood;[5] his daughter Jennifer had been born with \"severely clubbed\nfeet\", requiring extensive corrective surgery as a child.[9] Jennifer has said\nthat her own unexpected conception and birth defects were the basis for the\nfilm's themes.[9] The film's tone was also shaped by Lynch's time living in a\ntroubled neighborhood in Philadelphia. Lynch and his family spent five years\nliving in an atmosphere of \"violence, hate and filth\".[10] The area was rife\nwith crime, inspiring the bleak urban backdrop of _Eraserhead_. Describing\nthis period of his life, Lynch said, \"I saw so many things in Philadelphia I\ncouldn't believe\u00a0... I saw a grown woman grab her breasts and speak like a\nbaby, complaining her nipples hurt. This kind of thing will set you back\".[5]\nFilm critic Greg Olson, in his book _David Lynch: Beautiful Dark_, posits that\nthis time contrasted starkly with the director's childhood in the Pacific\nNorthwest, giving the director a \"bipolar, Heaven-and-Hell vision of America\"\nwhich has subsequently shaped his films.[10]\n\nInitial casting for the film began in 1971, and Jack Nance was quickly\nselected for the lead role. However, the staff at the AFI had underestimated\nthe project's scale\u2014they had initially green-lit _Eraserhead_ after viewing a\ntwenty-one page screenplay, assuming that the film industry's usual ratio of\none minute of film per scripted page would reduce the film to approximately\ntwenty minutes. This misunderstanding, coupled with Lynch's own meticulous\ndirection, caused the film to remain in production for a number of years.[4]\nIn an extreme example of this labored schedule, one scene in the film begins\nwith Nance's character opening a door\u2014a full year passed before he was filmed\nentering the room. Nance, however, was dedicated to producing the film and\nretained the unorthodox hairstyle his character sported for the entirety of\nits gestation.[11]\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\nBuoyed with regular donations from Lynch's childhood friend Jack Fisk and\nFisk's wife Sissy Spacek, production continued for several years.[12]\nAdditional funds were provided by Nance's wife Catherine E. Coulson, who\nworked as a waitress and donated her income,[13] and by Lynch himself, who\ndelivered newspapers throughout the film's principal photography.[14] During\none of the many lulls in filming, Lynch was able to produce the short film\n_The Amputee_, taking advantage of the AFI's wish to test new film stock\nbefore committing to bulk purchases.[15] The short piece starred Coulson, who\ncontinued working with Lynch as a technician on _Eraserhead_.[15]\n_Eraserhead_'s production crew was very small, composed of Lynch; sound\ndesigner Alan Splet; cinematographer Herb Cardwell, who died during production\nand was replaced with Frederick Elmes; production manager and prop technician\nDoreen Small; and Coulson, who worked in a variety of roles.[16]\n\n![A screenshot of the film, showing the bizarre animal-like\ninfant](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b8/Eraserhead_baby.jpg\n/220px-Eraserhead_baby.jpg)\n\nIt has been speculated that Lynch used a rabbit to create Spencer's alien-like\nbaby.\n\nThe physical effects used to create the deformed child have been kept secret.\nThe projectionist who worked on the film's dailies was blindfolded by Lynch to\navoid revealing the prop's nature, and he has refused to discuss the effects\nin subsequent interviews.[17] The prop\u2014which Nance had nicknamed\n\"Spike\"\u2014featured several working parts; its neck, eyes and mouth were capable\nof independent operation.[18] Lynch has offered cryptic comments on the prop,\nat times stating that \"it was born nearby\" or \"maybe it was found\".[19] It has\nbeen speculated by _The Guardian_'s John Patterson that the prop may have been\nconstructed from a skinned rabbit or a lamb's fetus.[20] The child has been\nseen as a precursor to elements of other Lynch films, such as John Merrick's\nmake-up in 1980's _The Elephant Man_ and the sandworms of 1984's _Dune_.[21]\n\nDuring production, Lynch began experimenting with a technique of recording\ndialogue that had been spoken phonetically backwards and reversing the\nresulting audio. Although the technique was not used in the film, Lynch\nreturned to it for \"Episode\u00a02\", the third episode of his 1990 television\nseries _Twin Peaks_.[22] Lynch also began his interest in Transcendental\nMeditation during the film's production,[5] adopting a vegetarian diet and\ngiving up smoking and alcohol consumption.[23]\n\n### Post-production[edit]\n\nLynch worked with Alan Splet to design the film's sound. The pair arranged and\nfabricated soundproof blanketing to insulate their studio, where they spent\nalmost a year creating and editing the film's sound effects. The soundtrack is\ndensely layered, including as many as fifteen different sounds played\nsimultaneously using multiple reels.[24] Sounds were created in a variety of\nways\u2014for a scene in which a bed slowly dissolves into a pool of liquid, Lynch\nand Splet inserted a microphone inside a plastic bottle, floated it in a\nbathtub, and recorded the sound of air blown through the bottle. After being\nrecorded, sounds were further augmented by alterations to their pitch, reverb\nand frequency.[25]\n\nAfter a poorly received test screening, in which Lynch believes he had mixed\nthe soundtrack at too high a volume, the director cut twenty minutes of\nfootage from the film, bringing its length to 89 minutes.[26] Among the cut\nfootage is a scene featuring Coulson as the infant's midwife, another of a man\ntorturing two women\u2014one again played by Coulson\u2014with a car battery, and one of\nSpencer toying with a dead cat.[27]\n\n## Soundtrack[edit]\n\nEraserhead  \n---  \nSoundtrack album by David Lynch, Peter Ivers and Fats Waller  \nReleased | 1982\u00a0(1982)  \nRecorded | 1976\u00a0(1976)\u20131977\u00a0(1977)  \nLength | 37:47  \nLabel | I.R.S.  \n  \nThe soundtrack to _Eraserhead_ was released by I.R.S. Records in 1982.[28] The\ntwo tracks included on the album feature excerpts of organ music by Fats\nWaller and the song \"In Heaven\", written for the film by Peter Ivers.[29] The\nsoundtrack was re-released on August 7, 2012, by Sacred Bones Records in a\nlimited pressing of 1,500\u00a0copies.[30] The album has been seen as presaging the\ndark ambient music genre, and its presentation of background noise and non-\nmusical cues has been described by Pitchfork Media's Mark Richardson as \"a\nsound track (two words) in the literal sense\".[31]\n\nNo. | Title | Length  \n---|---|---  \n1. | \"Excerpts from: Digah's Stomp/Lenox Avenue Blues/Stompin' the Bug/Messin'\" \u00a0 | 19:29  \n2. | \"In Heaven (Lady in the Radiator Song)\" \u00a0 | 18:18  \n  \n**Total length:**\n\n| **37:47**  \n  \n## Themes[edit]\n\n_Eraserhead_'s sound design has been considered one of its defining elements.\nAlthough the film features several hallmark visuals\u2014the deformed infant and\nthe sprawling industrial setting\u2014these are matched by their accompanying\nsounds, as the \"incessant mewling\" and \"evocative aural landscape\" are paired\nwith these respectively.[32] The film features several constant industrial\nsounds, providing low-level background noise in every scene. This fosters a\n\"threatening\" and \"unnerving\" atmosphere, which has been imitated in works\nsuch as David Fincher's 1995 thriller _Seven_ and the Coen brothers' 1991\ndrama _Barton Fink_.[32] The constant low-level noise has been perceived by\nJames Wierzbicki in his book _Music, Sound and Filmmakers: Sonic Style in\nCinema_ as perhaps a product of Henry Spencer's imagination, and the\nsoundtrack has been described as \"ruthlessly negligent of the difference\nbetween dream and reality\".[33] The film also begins a trend within Lynch's\nwork of relating diegetic music to dreams, as when the Lady in the Radiator\nsings \"In Heaven\" during Spencer's extended dream sequence. This is also\npresent in \"Episode 2\" of _Twin Peaks_, in which diegetic music carries over\nfrom a character's dream to his waking thoughts; and in 1986's _Blue Velvet_,\nin which a similar focus is given to Roy Orbison's \"In Dreams\".[33]\n\nThe film has also been noted for its strong sexual themes. Opening with an\nimage of conception, the film then portrays Henry Spencer as a character who\nis terrified of, but fascinated by, sex. The recurring images of sperm-like\ncreatures, including the child, are a constant presence during the film's sex\nscenes; the apparent \"girl next door\" appeal of the Lady in the Radiator is\nabandoned during her musical number as she begins to violently smash Spencer's\nsperm creatures and aggressively meets his gaze.[34] David J. Skal, in his\nbook _The Monster Show: A Cultural History of Horror_, has described the film\nas \"depict[ing] human reproduction as a desolate freak show, an occupation fit\nonly for the damned\".[35] Skal also posits a different characterization of the\nLady in the Radiator, casting her as \"desperately eager for an unseen\naudience's approval\".[35] In his book _David Lynch Decoded_, Mark Allyn\nStewart proposes that the Lady in the Radiator is in fact Spencer's\nsubconscious, a manifestation of his own urge to kill his child, who embraces\nhim after he does so, as if to reassure him that he has done right.[36]\n\nAs a character, Spencer has been seen as an everyman figure, his blank\nexpression and plain dress keeping him a simple archetype.[37] Spencer\ndisplays a pacifistic and fatalistic inactivity throughout the film, simply\nallowing events to unfold around him without taking control. This passive\nbehavior culminates in his sole act of instigation at the film's climax; his\napparent act of infanticide is driven by his life of being domineered and\ncontrolled. Spencer's inactivity has also been seen by film critics Colin\nOdell and Michelle Le Blanc as a precursor to Lynch's 1983\u201392 comic strip _The\nAngriest Dog in the World_.[38]\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n_Eraserhead_ premi\u00e8red at the Filmex film festival in Los Angeles, on March\n19, 1977.[39] On its opening night, the film was attended by twenty-five\npeople; twenty-four viewed it the following evening. However, Ben Barenholtz,\nhead of distributor Libra Films International, persuaded local theater Cinema\nVillage to run the film as a midnight feature, where it continued for a year.\nAfter this, it ran for ninety-nine weeks at New York's Waverly Cinema, had a\nyear-long midnight run at San Francisco's Roxie Theater from 1978 to 1979, and\nachieved a three-year tenure at Los Angeles' Nuart Theatre between 1978 and\n1981.[40] The film was a commercial success, grossing $7\u00a0million in the United\nStates.[2] _Eraserhead_ was also screened as part of the 1978 BFI London Film\nFestival,[41] and the 1986 Telluride Film Festival.[42]\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n_Eraserhead_ was released on VHS on August 7, 1982, by Columbia Pictures.[43]\nThe film was released on DVD and Blu-ray by Umbrella Entertainment in\nAustralia; the former was released on August 1, 2009,[44] and the latter on\nMay 9, 2012.[45] The Umbrella Entertainment releases include an 85-minute\nfeature on the making of the film.[44][45] Other home media releases of the\nfilm include DVD releases by Universal Pictures in 2001, Subversive\nEntertainment in 2006, Scanbox Entertainment in 2008,[42] and a DVD and Blu-\nray release by The Criterion Collection in September 2014.[46]\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\nUpon _Eraserhead_'s release, _Variety_ offered a negative review, calling it\n\"a sickening bad-taste exercise\".[47] The review expressed incredulity over\nthe film's long gestation and described its finale as unwatchable.[47]\nComparing _Eraserhead_ to Lynch's next film _The Elephant Man_, Tom Buckley of\n_The New York Times_ felt that while the latter was a well-made film with an\naccomplished cast, the former was not. Buckley called _Eraserhead_ \"murkily\npretentious\", and felt that the film's horror aspects stemmed solely from the\nappearance of the deformed child rather than from its script or\nperformances.[48] Writing in 1984, Lloyd Rose of _The Atlantic_ felt that\n_Eraserhead_ demonstrated that Lynch was \"one of the most unalloyed\nsurrealists ever to work in the movies\".[49] Rose described the film as being\nintensely personal, finding that unlike previous surrealist films, such as\nLuis Bu\u00f1uel's 1929 work _Un Chien Andalou_ or 1930's _L'Age d'Or_, Lynch's\nimagery \"isn't reaching out to us from his films; we're sinking into\nthem\".[49] In a 1993 review for the _Chicago Tribune_, Michael Wilmington\ndescribed _Eraserhead_ as unique, feeling that the film's \"intensity\" and\n\"nightmare clarity\" were a result of Lynch's attention to detail in its\ncreation due to his involvement in so many roles during its production.[50] In\nthe 1995 essay _Bad Ideas: The Art and Politics of Twin Peaks_, critic\nJonathan Rosenbaum felt that _Eraserhead_ represented Lynch's best work.\nRosenbaum felt that the director's artistic talent declined as his popularity\ngrew, and contrasted the film with _Wild at Heart_\u2014Lynch's most recent feature\nfilm at that time\u2014saying \"even the most cursory comparison of _Eraserhead_\nwith _Wild at Heart_ reveals an artistic decline so precipitous that it is\nhard to imagine the same person making both films\".[51]\n\nTwenty-first century critical opinion of the film is widely positive.\n_Eraserhead_ holds an average rating of 91% on review aggregation website\nRotten Tomatoes, representing the distillation of 55 reviews, with the\ncritical consensus \"David Lynch's surreal Eraserhead uses detailed visuals and\na creepy score to create a bizarre and disturbing look into a man's fear of\nparenthood.\"[52] Writing for _Empire_ magazine, Steve Beard rated the film\nfive stars out of five. He felt that it was \"a lot more radical and enjoyable\nthan [Lynch's] later Hollywood efforts\" and highlighted its mix of surrealist\nbody horror and black comedy.[53] The BBC's Almar Haflidason awarded\n_Eraserhead_ three stars out of five, describing it as \"an unremarkable feat\nby [Lynch's] later standards\".[54] Haflidason felt that the film was a\ngathering of loosely related ideas, adding that it is \"so consumed with\nsurreal imagery that there are almost limitless possibilities to read personal\ntheories into it\"; the reviewer's own take on these themes were that they\nrepresented a fear of personal commitment and featured \"a strong sexual\nundercurrent\".[54] A reviewer writing for Film4 rated _Eraserhead_ five stars\nout of five, describing it as \"by turns beautiful, annoying, funny,\nexasperating and repellent, but always bristling with a nervous energy\".[55]\nThe Film4 reviewer felt that _Eraserhead_ was unlike most films released to\nthat point, save for the collaborations between Luis Bu\u00f1uel and Salvador Dal\u00ed;\nhowever, Lynch denies having seen any of these before _Eraserhead_.[55]\nWriting for _The Village Voice_, Nathan Lee praised the film's use of sound,\nwriting \"to see the film means nothing\u2014one must also _hear_ it\".[56] He\ndescribed the film's sound design as \"an intergalactic seashell cocked to the\nears of an acid-tripping gargantua\".[56]\n\n_The Guardian_'s Peter Bradshaw similarly lauded the film, also awarding it\nfive stars out of five. Bradshaw considered it to be a beautiful film,\ndescribing its sound design as \"industrial groaning, as if filmed inside some\ncollapsing factory or gigantic dying organism\".[57] He highlighted the film's\nbody horror elements, comparing it to Ridley Scott's 1979 film _Alien_.[57]\nKeith Phipps, writing for AllRovi, also gave the film a rating of five stars\nout of five; he highlighted the disturbing sound design of the film and\ndescribed it as \"an open metaphor\".[42] He felt that _Eraserhead_ \"sets up the\nobsessions that would follow [Lynch] through his career\", adding his belief\nthat the film's surrealism enhanced the understanding of the director's later\nfilms.[42] In an article for _The Daily Telegraph_, film-maker Marc Evans\npraised both the sound design and Lynch's ability \"to make the ordinary seem\nso odd\", considering the film an inspiration on his own work.[58] A review of\nthe film in the same newspaper compared _Eraserhead_ to the works of Irish\nplaywright Samuel Beckett, describing it as a chaotic parody of family\nlife.[59] Manohla Dargis, writing for _The New York Times_, called the film\n\"less a straight story than a surrealistic assemblage\".[21] Dargis felt that\nthe film's imagery evoked the paintings of Francis Bacon and the Georges\nFranju 1949 documentary _Blood of the Beasts_.[21] _Film Threat_'s Phil Hall\ncalled _Eraserhead_ Lynch's best film, believing that the director's\nsubsequent output failed to live up to it.[60] Hall highlighted the film's\nsoundtrack and Nance's \"Chaplinesque\" physical comedy as the film's stand-out\nelements.[60]\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\nIn 2004, _Eraserhead_ was selected for preservation in the National Film\nRegistry by the United States Library of Congress. Selection for the Registry\nis based on a film being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically\nsignificant\".[61] _Eraserhead_ was one of the subjects featured in the 2005\ndocumentary _Midnight Movies: From the Margin to the Mainstream_, which\ncharted the rise of the midnight movie phenomenon in the late 1960s and 1970s;\nLynch took part in the documentary through a series of interviews. The\nproduction covers six films which are credited as creating and popularizing\nthe genre; also included are _Night of the Living Dead_, _El Topo_, _Pink\nFlamingos_, _The Harder They Come_, and _The Rocky Horror Picture Show_.[62]\nIn 2010, the Online Film Critics Society compiled a list of the 100 best\ndirectorial d\u00e9buts, listing what they felt were the best first-time feature\nfilms by noted directors. _Eraserhead_ placed second in the poll, behind Orson\nWelles' 1941 _Citizen Kane_.[63]\n\nLynch collaborated with most of the cast and crew of _Eraserhead_ again on\nlater films. Frederick Elmes served as cinematographer on _Blue Velvet_,[64]\n1988's _The Cowboy and the Frenchman_, and 1990's _Wild at Heart_.[65] Alan\nSplet provided sound design for _The Elephant Man_, _Dune_, and _Blue\nVelvet_.[66] Jack Fisk directed episodes of Lynch's 1992 television series _On\nthe Air_[67] and worked as a production designer on 1999's _The Straight\nStory_ and 2001's _Mulholland Drive_.[68] Coulson and Nance appeared in _Twin\nPeaks_,[69] and made further appearances in _Dune_,[70] _Blue Velvet_,[64]\n_Wild at Heart_,[71] and 1997's _Lost Highway_.[72]\n\nFollowing the release of _Eraserhead_, Lynch attempted to find funding for his\nnext project, _Ronnie Rocket_, a film \"about electricity and a three-foot guy\nwith red hair\".[73] Lynch met film producer Stuart Cornfeld during this time.\nCornfeld had enjoyed _Eraserhead_ and was interested in producing _Ronnie\nRocket_; he worked for Mel Brooks and Brooksfilms at the time, and when the\ntwo realized that _Ronnie Rocket_ was unlikely to find sufficient financing,\nLynch asked to see some already-written scripts to consider for his next\nproject. Cornfeld found four scripts that he felt would interest Lynch; on\nhearing the title of _The Elephant Man_, the director decided to make it his\nsecond film.[74]\n\nWhile working on _The Elephant Man_, Lynch met American director Stanley\nKubrick, who revealed to Lynch that _Eraserhead_ was his favorite film.[75]\n_Eraserhead_ also served as an influence on Kubrick's 1980 film _The Shining_;\nKubrick reportedly screened the film for the cast and crew to \"put them in the\nmood\" that he wanted the film to achieve.[76] _Eraserhead_ is also credited\nwith influencing the 1990 Japanese cyberpunk film _Tetsuo: The Iron Man_, the\nexperimental 1990 horror film _Begotten_, and Darren Aronofsky's 1998\ndirectorial debut _Pi_.[77][78][79] Swiss surrealist H. R. Giger cited\n_Eraserhead_ as \"one of the greatest films [he had] ever seen\",[80] and said\nthat it came closer to realizing his vision than even his own films.[81]\nAccording to Giger, Lynch declined to collaborate with him on _Dune_ because\nhe felt Giger had \"stolen his ideas\".[82]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * List of films shot over three or more years\n\n## Footnotes[edit]\n\n  1. **^** \"_Eraserhead_ (X)\". _British Board of Film Classification_.

Born into a Malay aristocratic family in the Sultanate of Langkat in North Sumatra, he was educated in both Sumatra and Java. While attending senior high school in Surakarta around 1930, the youth became involved with the nationalist movement and fell in love with a Javanese schoolmate, Ilik Sundari. Even after Amir continued his studies in legal school in Batavia (now Jakarta) the two remained close, only separating in 1937 when Amir was recalled to Sumatra to marry the sultan's daughter and take on responsibilities of the court. Though unhappy with his marriage, he fulfilled his courtly duties. After Indonesia proclaimed its independence in 1945, he served as the government's representative in Langkat. The following year he was killed in a socialist revolution led by the Communist Party of Indonesia and buried in a mass grave.\n\nAmir began writing poetry while still a teenager: though his works are\nundated, the earliest are thought to have been written when he first travelled\nto Java. Drawing influences from his own Malay culture and Islam, as well as\nfrom Christianity and Eastern literature, Amir wrote 50 poems, 18 pieces of\nlyrical prose, and numerous other works, including several translations. In\n1932 he co-founded the literary magazine _Poedjangga Baroe_. After his return\nto Sumatra, he stopped writing. Most of his poems were published in two\ncollections, _Nyanyi Sunyi_ (1937) and _Buah Rindu_ (1941), first in\n_Poedjangga Baroe_ then as stand-alone books.\n\nPoems by Amir deal with the themes of love and religion and his poetry often\nreflects a deep inner conflict. His diction, using both Malay and Javanese\nwords and expanding on traditional structures, was influenced by the need for\nrhythm and metre, as well as symbolism related to particular terms. His\nearlier works deal with a sense of longing and both erotic and idealised love,\nwhereas his later works have a deeper religious meaning. Of his two\ncollections, _Nyanyi Sunyi_ is considered the most developed. Amir has been\ncalled the \"King of the Poedjangga Baroe-era Poets\" and the only\ninternational-class Indonesian poet from before the Indonesian National\nRevolution.[1]\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Biography\n    * 1.1 Early life\n    * 1.2 Java\n    * 1.3 Return to Langkat\n    * 1.4 Post-Independence and death\n  * 2 Influences\n  * 3 Works\n    * 3.1 _Nyanyi Sunyi_\n    * 3.2 _Buah Rindu_\n  * 4 Style\n  * 5 Awards and recognition\n  * 6 Explanatory notes\n  * 7 References\n  * 8 Works cited\n\n## Biography[edit]\n\n### Early life[edit]\n\nAmir was born as Tengkoe Amir Hamzah Pangeran Indra Poetera[b] in Tanjung\nPura, Langkat, North Sumatra, the youngest son of Vice Sultan Tengku Muhammad\nAdil and his third wife Tengku Mahjiwa. Through his father, he was related to\nthe Sultan of Langkat, Machmud. Sources disagree over his date of birth. The\ndate officially recognised by the Indonesian government is 28 February 1911, a\ndate Amir used throughout his life. However, his elder brother Abdullah Hod\nstates that the poet was born on 11 February 1911. Amir later took the name of\nhis grandfather, Teungku Hamzah, as a second name; thus, he was referred to as\nAmir Hamzah. Though a child of nobility, he would often associate with non-\nnobles.[2]\n\nIt is known that Amir was schooled in Islamic principles such as Qu'ran\nreading, _fiqh_, and _tawhid_, and studied at the Azizi Mosque in Tanjung Pura\nfrom a young age.[3] He remained a devout Muslim throughout his life. Sources\ndisagree on the period in which he completed his formal studies. Several\nsources, including the Indonesian government's Language Centre, state that he\nstarted school in 1916,[4] while the biographer M. Lah Husny puts the future\npoet's first year of formal schooling as 1918.[5] At the Dutch-language\nelementary school where Amir first studied, he began writing[6] and received\ngood marks;[7] in her biography of him, Nh. Dini writes that Amir was\nnicknamed \"older brother\" (_abang_) by his classmates as he was much taller\nthan them.[3]\n\nIn 1924[8] or 1925,[9] Amir graduated from the school in Langkat and moved to\nMedan to study at the _Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs_ (MULO; middle school)\nthere.[10] After completing his studies some two years later, he entered a\nformal relationship with his cousin from his mother's side, Aja (also Aje)\nBun.[11] Husny writes that the two were arranged to be married by their\nparents,[12] while Dini casts the relationship as a vow to be always\nfaithful.[13] As his parents permitted him to finish his studies in Java, Amir\nmoved to the colonial capital at Batavia (now Jakarta) to complete his\nstudies.[12]\n\n### Java[edit]\n\nAlone aboard the _Plancus_,[14] Amir made the three-day boat trip to Java.[15]\nUpon arriving at Batavia, he enrolled at a Christian MULO there, where he\ncompleted his last year of junior high school.[12] Anthony H. Johns of\nAustralian National University writes that he learned some Christian concepts\nand values.[16] Also in Batavia, Amir became involved with the social\norganisation Jong Sumatera.[17] During this period, the young man wrote his\nfirst poems. Husny credits several to his heartbreak after he found that Aja\nBun had been married to another man without Amir's knowing (the two never\nspoke again),[18] while Dini suggests that the poem \"Tinggallah\" was written\nnot long after he boarded the _Plancus_, while he was longing after his\nparents.[19]\n\n![A man with glasses, looking left](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/t\nhumb/5/53/Armijn_Pane%2C_around_1953.jpg/175px-Armijn_Pane%2C_around_1953.jpg)\n\n![A man in a striped shirt, looking forward](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/\ncommons/thumb/6/6d/Sutan_Takdir_Alisjahbana_Kesusastraan_Modern_Indonesia_p6.j\npg/175px-Sutan_Takdir_Alisjahbana_Kesusastraan_Modern_Indonesia_p6.jpg)\n\nAmir established _Poedjangga Baroe_ with Armijn Pane (_top_) and Sutan Takdir\nAlisjahbana.\n\nAfter a brief return to Sumatra, Amir continued to a Boedi Oetomo-operated\n_Algemene Middelbare School_ (AMS; senior high school) in Surakarta, Central\nJava, where he studied eastern literature and languages, including Javanese,\nSanskrit, and Arabic.[20] Preferring solitude to the bustle of the\ndormitories, Amir boarded at a privately-owned home of a Surakartan\nresident.[21] Later he met several future writers, including Armijn Pane and\nAchdiat Karta Mihardja;[22] they soon found him to be a friendly and diligent\nstudent with complete notes and a spotless bedroom (sheets folded so well,\nMihardja later recalled, that a \"lost fly could have easily slid over\nthem\"[c]), but also a romantic prone to thinking wistfully beneath the\nlamplight and isolating himself from his classmates.[23]\n\nIn Surakarta Amir joined the nationalist movement. He would meet with fellow\nSumatrans and discuss the social plight of the Malay archipelago's populace\nunder Dutch colonial rule. Though most educated youth at the time preferred\nusing Dutch, he insisted on speaking Malay.[24] In 1930 Amir became head of\nthe Surakartan branch of the Indonesia Muda (Young Indonesians), delivering a\nspeech at the 1930 Youth Congress and serving as an editor of the\norganisation's magazine _Garuda Merapi_.[25] At school he also met Ilik\nSundari, a Javanese woman nearly his age with whom he fell in love.[26]\nSundari, the daughter of Raden Mas Kusumodihardjo, was one of the few female\nstudents at the school, and her home was near one of those in which Amir\nboarded. According to Dini, the two grew closer, Amir teaching Sundari Arabic\nand Sundari teaching him Javanese.[27] They were soon meeting every day,\nconversing on a variety of topics.[28]\n\nAmir's mother died in 1931, and his father the year after, meaning that his\neducation could no longer be funded. After his AMS studies concluded, he\nwanted to continue to study at a law school in Batavia. As such, he wrote to\nhis brother, Jakfar, who arranged for the remainder of his studies to be paid\nfor by the Sultan. In 1932 Amir was able to return to Batavia and begin his\nlegal studies,[29] taking up a part-time job as a teacher.[30] At first, his\nrelationship with Sundari was continued through letters, though she soon\ncontinued her studies in Lembang, a city much closer than Surakarta; this\nallowed the two to meet furtively[31]\u00a0\u2013 when Sundari's parents had discovered\ntheir relationship, Amir and Sundari had been forbidden from meeting.[32]\n\nThis year Amir's first two poems, \"Sunyi\" (\"Silent\") and \"Mabuk...\"\n(\"Nauseous...\"), were published in the March edition of the magazine\n_Timboel_. His other eight works published in 1932 included a _syair_ based on\nthe _Hikayat Hang Tuah_,[33] three other poems, two pieces of lyrical prose,\nand two short stories; the poems were again published in _Timboel_, while the\nprose was included in the magazine _Pandji Poestaka_.[34] Around September\n1932 Armijn Pane, upon the urgings of Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana, editor of\n\"Memadjoekan Sastera\" (\"Advancing Literature\", the literary section of _Pandji\nPoestaka_), invited Amir to help them establish an independent literary\nmagazine.[35] Amir accepted, and was tasked with writing letters to solicit\nsubmissions;[35] a total of fifty letters were sent to noted writers,\nincluding forty sent to contributors to \"Memadjoekan Sastera\".[36] After\nseveral months of preparations, the initial edition was published in July\n1933,[37] under the title _Poedjangga Baroe_. The new magazine was left under\nthe editorial control of Armijn and Alisjahbana,[38] while Amir published\nalmost all of his subsequent writings there.[34]\n\nIn mid-1933 Amir was recalled to Langkat, where the Sultan informed him of two\nconditions which he had to fulfil to continue his studies: be a diligent\nstudent and abandon the independence movement.[39] Despite the Sultan's\ndisapproval, Amir became more heavily involved in the nationalist movement,\nbringing him under increasing Dutch scrutiny.[40] He continued to publish in\n_Poedjangga Baroe_, including a series of five articles on Eastern literatures\nfrom June to December 1934 and a translation of the _Bhagavad Gita_ from 1933\nto 1935.[34] His legal studies, however, were delayed, and by 1937 he had\nstill not graduated.[41]\n\n### Return to Langkat[edit]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Amir_Hamzah_wedding.JP\nG/220px-Amir_Hamzah_wedding.JPG)\n\nAmir and Kamiliah at their wedding, 1937\n\nThe Dutch, concerned about Amir's nationalistic tendencies, convinced the\nSultan to send him back to Langkat, an order which the fledgling poet was\nunable to refuse. In 1937, Amir, together with two of the Sultan's vassals\ntasked with escorting him, boarded the _Opten Noort_ from Tanjung Priok and\nreturned to Sumatra. Upon arriving in Langkat, he was informed that he was to\nbe married to the Sultan's eldest daughter, Tengku Puteri Kamiliah, a woman he\nhad barely met.[41] Before the wedding Amir returned to Batavia to face his\nfinal exam\u00a0\u2013 and have one last meeting with Sundari.[42] Several weeks later\nhe returned to Langkat, where he and Kamiliah were married in an extravagant\nceremony.[41] His cousin, Tengku Burhan, later stated that Amir's indifference\nthroughout the seven-day event was due to his thinking of Sundari.[43]\n\nNow a prince (_pangeran_),[41] Amir was given the title Tengku Pangeran Indra\nPutera.[44] He lived with Kamiliah in their own home. By all accounts, she was\na devout and loving wife, and in 1939 the couple had their only child, a\ndaughter named Tengku Tahura.[d][45] According to Dini, Amir professed to\nKamiliah that he could never love her as he had Sundari and that he felt\nobligated to marry her, something which Kamiliah reportedly accepted. The poet\nretained an album with his Javanese sweetheart's photographs at home[46] and\nwould often isolate himself from his family, lost in thought.[47] As a prince\nof Langkat, Amir became a court official, handling administrative and legal\nmatters, and at times judging criminal cases.[48] He once represented the\nsultanate at the funeral of Pakubuwono\u00a0X in Java\u00a0\u2013 Amir's last trip to the\nisland.[49]\n\nAlthough Amir had little correspondence with his friends in Java,[50] his\npoems\u00a0\u2013 most of which had been written in Java\u00a0\u2013 continued to be published in\n_Poedjangga Baroe_. His first poetry collection, _Nyanyi Sunyi_ (_Songs of\nSilence_), was published in the magazine's November 1937 edition. Nearly two\nyears later, in June 1939, the magazine published a collection of poems Amir\nhad translated, entitled _Setanggi Timur_ (_Incense from the East_). In June\n1941 his last collection, _Buah Rindu_ (_Fruits of Longing_), was\npublished.[34] All were later republished as stand-alone books.[51] A last\nbook, _Sastera Melayu Lama dan Raja-Rajanya_ (_Old Malay Literature and its\nKings_), was published in Medan in 1942; this was based on a radio speech Amir\nhad delivered.[34]\n\nAfter the German invasion of the Netherlands in 1940, the government of the\nIndies began preparing for a possible Japanese invasion. In Langkat, a Home\nGuard, or _Stadswacht_, division was established to defend Tanjung Pura, in\nLangkat. Amir and his cousin Tengku Harun were in charge; the nobility,\ntrusted by the general populace, was selected to ensure easier recruitment of\ncommoners. When the invasion became a reality in early 1942, Amir was one of\nthe soldiers sent to Medan to defend it. He and the other Dutch-allied forces\nwere quickly captured by the Japanese. He was held as a prisoner of war until\n1943, when influence from the Sultan allowed him to be released. Throughout\nthe remainder of the occupation, which lasted until 1945, Amir was employed as\na radio commentator and censor in Medan.[52] In his position as prince, he was\ntasked with helping to collect rice to feed the Japanese occupation army.[50]\n\n### Post-Independence and death[edit]\n\nAfter Indonesia proclaimed its independence on 17 August 1945, the entirety of\nSumatra was declared a _de facto_ part of the country. The central government\nestablished Teuku Muhammad Hasan as the island's first governor, and on 29\nOctober 1945 Hasan selected Amir as the government representative in Langkat\n(later equated to regent), with his office at Binjai.[53] Amir accepted the\nposition readily,[54] subsequently handling numerous tasks set by the central\ngovernment, including inaugurating the first local division of the People's\nSafety Army (_Tentara Keamanan Rakjat_; the predecessor to the Indonesian\nArmy)[53] opening meetings of various local branches of national political\nparties,[55] and promoting education\u00a0\u2013 particularly Latin-alphabet\nliteracy.[54]\n\nThe ongoing Indonesian National Revolution, with various battles in Java,\nmeant that the newly established republic was unstable.[56] In early 1946,\nrumours spread in Langkat that Amir had been seen dining with representatives\nof the returning Dutch government,[57] and there was growing unrest within the\ngeneral populace.[58] On 7 March 1946, during a socialist revolution led by\nfactions of the Communist Party of Indonesia, a group staunchly against\nfeudalism and the nobility, Amir's power was stripped from him and he was\narrested;[59] Kamiliah and Tahura escaped.[60] Together with other members of\nthe Langkat nobility, he was sent to a Communist-held plantation at Kuala\nBegumit, some 10 kilometres (6\u00a0mi) outside of Binjai.[59] Later testimony\nsuggests that the detainees were tried by their captors, forced to dig holes,\nand tortured.[61]\n\nAmir's last piece of writing, a fragment from his 1941 poem \"Buah Rindu\", was\nlater found in his cell:[62]\n\n_**Original**_ | _**Translation**_  \n---|---  \n  \nWahai maut, datanglah engkau  \nLepaskan aku dari nestapa  \nPadamu lagi tempatku berpaut  \nDisaat ini gelap gulita\n\n|\n\nCome then, oh Death  \nRelease me from mine suffering  \nTo you, again, must I cling  \nIn these most dark times  \n  \nOn the morning of 20 March 1946, Amir was killed with 26\u00a0other people and\nburied in a mass grave which the detainees had dug;[e][63] several of his\nsiblings were also killed in the revolution.[64] After it was quashed by\nnationalist forces, the revolution's leaders were questioned by a team led by\nAmir Sjarifuddin and Adnan Kapau Gani: they are reported to have repeatedly\nasked \"Where is Amir Hamzah?\" during the investigation.[65] In 1948 the grave\nat Kuala Begumit was dug up and the remains identified by family members;\nAmir's bones were identified owing to a missing false tooth.[66] In November\n1949 his body was reinterred at the Azizi Mosque in Tanjung Pura, Langkat.[67]\n\n## Influences[edit]\n\nAmir was raised in a court setting, where he spoke Malay until it had \"become\nhis flesh and blood\".[f][68] From a young age he was exposed to oral and\nwritten _pantuns_ and _syair_, both listening and improvisationally creating\nhis own.[69] As with his father before him, Amir enjoyed traditional texts,\nsuch as _Hikayat Hang Tuah_, _Syair Siti Zubaidah_, and _Hikayat Panca\nTanderan_. He would listen to these when they were read in public\nceremonies,[68] and as an adult he kept a large collection of such texts,\nthough these were destroyed during the communist revolution.[69]\n\nThroughout his formal education Amir read works of Arabic, Persian, and Hindu\nliterature.[70] He was also influenced by works from other Eastern\ncountries:[71] poems translated in _Setanggi Timur_, for instance, include\nworks by Omar Khayy\u00e1m (Persia), Du Fu (China), Fukuda Chiyo-ni (Japan), and\nRabindranath Tagore (India).[34] These works were not read in the original,\nbut from Dutch translations.[72] The literary critic Muhammad Balfas writes\nthat, unlike his contemporaries, Amir drew little influence from sonnets and\nthe neo-romantic Dutch poets, the _Tachtigers_;[73] Johns comes to the same\nconclusion.[74] The Australian literary scholar Keith Foulcher, however,\nnoting that the poet quoted Willem Kloos's \"Lenteavond\" in his article on\n_pantuns_, suggests that Amir was very likely influenced by the\n_Tachtigers_.[75]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/df/Ilik_Sundari_by_Amir_Hamzah\n.jpg/220px-Ilik_Sundari_by_Amir_Hamzah.jpg)\n\nIlik Sundari, photographed by Amir; she has widely been credited as his muse.\n\nMany writers have commented on Amir's influence from Islamic doctrine. The\nIndonesian literary documentarian H.B. Jassin[76] and the poet Arief Bagus\nPrasetyo,[77] among others, argue that Amir was a purely orthodox Muslim and\nthat it showed in his work. Prasetyo argues that this was evident in his\ntreatment of God; he does not view God as his equal, a theme found in the\nworks of such Sufi poets as Hamzah Fansuri, but as the master to Amir's\nservant.[77] Johns writes that, though he was not a mystic, Amir was also not\na purely devotional writer, instead promoting a form of \"Islamic\nHumanism\".[78] Others, such as the Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A.\nTeeuw and the Indonesian scholar of literature Abdul Hadi WM, find Amir to be\ninfluenced by Sufism.[77] Aprinus Salam of Gadjah Mada University, of the same\nposition, points to the instances where Hamzah treats God as a lover as\nindicative of Sufi influence.[79] Ultimately, the poet Chairil Anwar wrote\nthat Amir's _Nyanyi Sunyi_ could be termed \"obscure poetry\" as readers cannot\nunderstand the works without prior knowledge of Malay history and Islam.[80]\n\nSome attempts have also been made to connect Amir's works to a Christian\nperspective. In analysing \"Padamu Jua\", the Indonesian critic Bakri Siregar\nsuggests that some influences from the Christian Bible are evident, pointing\nto several aspects of the poem that would seem to support such a view,\nincluding the depiction of an anthropomorphic God (not allowed in orthodox\nIslam) and the idea of a jealous God. He writes that the concept of a jealous\nGod is not found in Islam, but is in the Bible, citing Exodus 20:5 and Exodus\n34:14.[81] In another poem, \"Permainanmu\", Hamzah uses the sentence \"Kau\nkeraskan kalbunya\" (You harden his heart); Jassin draws a parallel to God\nhardening the Pharaoh's heart in the Book of Exodus.[g][82]\n\nJassin writes that Amir's poems were also influenced by his love for one or\nmore women, in _Buah Rindu_ referred to as \"Tedja\" and \"Sendari-Dewi\"; he\nopines that the woman or women are never named as Amir's love for them is the\nkey.[83] Husny writes that at least nine of the works in _Buah Rindu_[h] were\ninspired by his longing for Aja Bun, portraying a sense of disappointment\nafter their engagement was called off.[84] Regarding the book's three-part\ndedication, \"to the mournful Greater Indonesia / to the ashes of the Mother-\nQueen / and to the feet of the Sendari-Goddess\",[i][85] Mihardja writes that\nSundari was immediately recognisable to any of Amir's classmates; he considers\nher the poet's inspiration as \"Laura to Petrarch, Mathilde to Jacques\nPerk\".[86] The critic Zuber Usman finds Sundari's influence on _Nyanyi Sunyi_\nas well, suggesting his parting from her led Amir closer to God,[87] an\nopinion Dini echoes.[88] The translator Burton Raffel connects a couplet at\nthe end of the book, reading \"Sunting sanggul melayah rendah / sekaki sajak\nseni sedih\"[89] (\"A flower floating in a loose knot of hair / Gave birth to my\nsorrowful poems\") as a call out to a forbidden love.[90] Dini credits Amir's\nlove for Sundari for his frequent use of Javanese terms in his writing.[43]\n\n## Works[edit]\n\nMain article: List of works by Amir Hamzah\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Cover_Poedjangga_Baroe\n_1937.jpg/220px-Cover_Poedjangga_Baroe_1937.jpg)\n\nA 1937 cover of _Poedjangga Baroe_; the magazine published most of Amir's\nworks.\n\nAltogether Amir wrote fifty poems, eighteen pieces of lyrical prose, twelve\narticles, four short stories, three poetry collections, and one original book.\nHe also translated forty-four poems, one piece of lyrical prose, and one\nbook;[34] these translations, Johns writes, generally reflected themes\nimportant in his original work.[91]\n\nThe vast majority of Amir's writings were published in _Poedjangga Baroe_,\nalthough some earlier ones were published in _Timboel_ and _Pandji\nPoestaka_.[34] None of his creative works are dated, and there is no consensus\nregarding when individual poems were written.[92] However, there is a\nconsensus that the works included in _Nyanyi Sunyi_ were written after those\nincluded in _Buah Rindu_, despite the latter being published last.[93] Johns\nwrites that the poems in the collections appear to be arranged in\nchronological order; he points to the various degrees of maturity Amir showed\nas his writing developed.[94]\n\nJassin writes that Amir maintained a Malay identity throughout his works,\ndespite attending schools run by Europeans. Unlike the works of his\ncontemporaries Alisjahbana or Sanusi Pane, his poems did not include symbols\nof a Europeanised modernity such as electricity, trains, telephones, and\nengines, allowing \"the natural Malay world to show wholly\".[j] Ultimately,\nwhen reading Amir's poems \"in our imagination we do not see a man in pants, a\njacket, and tie, but a youth in traditional Malay garb\".[k][95] Mihardja notes\nthat Amir wrote his works at a time when all of their classmates, and many\npoets elsewhere, were \"pouring their hearts or thoughts\"[l] in Dutch, or, if\n\"able to free themselves from the shackles of Dutch\",[m] in a local\nlanguage.[96]\n\nAmir's work often dealt with love (both erotic and idealised), with religious\ninfluences showing in many of his poems.[73] Mysticism is important in many of\nhis works, and his poetry often reflects a deep inner conflict.[97] In at\nleast one of his short stories, he criticised the traditional view of nobility\nand \"subverts the traditional representation of female characters\".[98] There\nare several thematic differences between his two original poetry\ncollections,[99] discussed further below.\n\n### _Nyanyi Sunyi_[edit]\n\nMain article: Nyanyi Sunyi\n\n_Nyanyi Sunyi_, Amir's first poetry collection, was published in the November\n1937 issue of _Poedjangga Baroe_,[100] then as a stand-alone book by Poestaka\nRakjat in 1938.[51] It consists of twenty-four titled pieces and an untitled\nquatrain,[101] including Hamzah's best-known poem, \"Padamu Jua\". Jassin\nclassifies eight of these works as lyrical prose, with the remaining thirteen\nas regular poems.[100] Although it is his first published collection, based on\nthe well-developed nature of the poems within,[102] general consensus is that\nthe works in _Buah Rindu_ were written earlier.[103] The poet Laurens Koster\nBohang considers the poems included in _Nyanyi Sunyi_ as having been written\nbetween 1933 and 1937,[104] while Teeuw dates the poems to 1936 and 1937.[105]\n\nReadings of _Nyanyi Sunyi_ have tended to focus on religious undertones.\nAccording to Balfas, religion and God are omnipresent throughout the\ncollection, beginning with its first poem \"Padamu Jua\".[106] In it, Jassin\nwrites, Amir shows a feeling of dissatisfaction over his own lack of power and\nprotests God's absoluteness,[107] but seems aware of his own smallness before\nGod, acting as a puppet for God's will.[108] Teeuw summarises that Amir\nrecognises that he would not exist if God did not.[109] Jassin finds that the\ntheme of religion is meant as an escape from the poet's worldly sorrows.[110]\nJohns, however, suggests that ultimately Amir finds little solace in God, as\nhe \"did not possess the transcendent faith which can make a great sacrifice,\nand resolutely accept the consequences\"; instead, he seems to regret his\nchoice to go to Sumatra and then revolts against God.[111]\n\n### _Buah Rindu_[edit]\n\nMain article: Buah Rindu\n\nAmir's second poetry collection, _Buah Rindu_, was published in the June 1941\nissue of _Poedjangga Baroe_,[112] then as a stand-alone book by Poestaka\nRakjat later that year.[51] It consists of twenty-five titled pieces and an\nuntitled quatrain; one, \"Buah Rindu\", consists of four parts, while another,\n\"Bonda\", consists of two. At least eleven of the works had previously been\npublished, either in _Timboel_ or in _Pandji Poestaka_.[112] This collection\nthough published after _Nyanyi Sunyi_, is generally considered to have been\nwritten earlier.[103] The poems in _Buah Rindu_ date to the period between\n1928 and 1935, Amir's first years in Java;[104] the collection gives the two\nyears, as well the location of writing as Jakarta\u2013Solo\n(Surakarta)\u2013Jakarta.[17]\n\nTeeuw writes that this collection is united by a theme of longing,[113] which\nJassin expands on: longing for his mother, longing for his lovers (both the\none in Sumatra and the one in Java), and longing for his homeland. All are\nreferred to as \"kekasih\" (_beloved_) in turn.[114] These longings, Teeuw\nwrites, are unlike the religious overtones of _Nyanyi Sunyi_, being more\nworldly and grounded in reality.[99] Jassin notes another thematic distinction\nbetween the two: unlike _Nyanyi Sunyi_, with its clear depiction of one god,\n_Buah Rindu_ explicitly puts forth several deities, including the Hindu gods\nShiva and Parvati and abstract ones like the god and goddess of love.[114]\n\n## Style[edit]\n\nAmir's diction was influenced by the need for rhythm and metre, as well as\nsymbolism related to particular terms.[115] This careful diction emphasised\nsimple words as the basic unit and occasional uses of alliteration and\nassonance.[116] Ultimately he is freer in his language use than traditional\npoets:[106] Jennifer Lindsay and Ying Ying Tan highlight his \"verbal\ninventiveness\", injecting a \"lavishness of expression, a mellifluous of sound\nand meaning\" into his poetry.[117] Siregar writes that the result is \"a\nbeautiful wordplay\".[n][118] Teeuw writes that Amir had a complete\nunderstanding of the strengths and weaknesses of Malay, mixing eastern and\nwestern influences,[116] whilst Johns writes that his \"genius as a poet lay in\nhis remarkable ability to resurrect the burnt-out embers of Malay poetry, and\nto infuse into the forms and rich vocabulary of traditional Malay an\nunexpected and vivid freshness and life.\"[119]\n\nThe choice of words depends heavily on old Malay terms which saw little\ncontemporary use. Amir also borrows heavily from other Indonesian languages,\nparticularly Javanese and Sundanese;[120] the influences are more predominant\nin _Nyanyi Sunyi_.[121] As such, early printings of _Nyanyi Sunyi_ and _Buah\nRindu_ were accompanied by footnotes explaining these words.[73] Teeuw writes\nthat the poems included numerous clich\u00e9s common in _pantuns_ which would not\nbe understood by foreign readers.[122] According to the translator John M.\nEchols, Amir was a writer of great sensitivity who was \"not a prolific writer\nbut his prose and poetry are on a very high level, though difficult reading\neven for Indonesians.\"[97] Echols credits Amir with a revival of the Malay\nlanguage, breathing new life into Malay literature in the 1930s.[123]\n\nStructurally, Amir's early works are quite different from his later ones. The\nworks compiled in _Buah Rindu_ generally followed the traditional _pantun_ and\n_syair_ style of quatrains with tail rhymes, including many with rhyming\ncouplets;[116] some works, however, combined the two, or had additional lines\nor more words than traditionally acceptable, resulting in a different\nrhythm.[124] Though these early works were not as detailed as Amir's later\nworks, Teeuw writes that they did reflect the poet's mastery of the language\nand his drive to write poems.[125] Works in this anthology repeated terms of\nsadness such as _menangis_ (cry), _duka_ (grief), _rindu_ (longing), and _air\nmata_ (tears), as well as words such as _cinta_ (love), _asmara_ (passion),\nand _merantau_ (wander).[126]\n\nBy the time Amir wrote the works later compiled in _Nyanyi Sunyi,_ his style\nhad shifted. No longer did he confine himself to the traditional forms, but\ninstead he explored different possibilities: eight of his works approached\nlyrical prose in form.[127] Anwar described his predecessor's use of language\nin the collection as clean and pure, with \"compactly violent, sharp, and yet\nshort\" sentences which departed from the \"destructive force\" of flowery\ntraditional Malay poetry.[128]\n\n## Awards and recognition[edit]\n\nAmir has received extensive recognition from the Indonesian government,\nbeginning with recognition from the government of North Sumatra soon after his\ndeath.[129] In 1969 he was granted both a Satya Lencana Kebudayaan (Satya\nLencana Award for Culture) and Piagam Anugerah Seni (Art Prize).[130] In 1975\nhe was declared a National Hero of Indonesia.[8] A park named after him, Taman\nAmir Hamzah, is found in Jakarta near the National Monument.[70] A mosque in\nTaman Ismail Marzuki, opened to the public in 1977, is also named after\nhim.[131] Several streets are named after Amir, including in Medan,[132]\nMataram,[133] and Surabaya.[134]\n\nTeeuw considers Amir the only international-class Indonesian poet from before\nthe Indonesian National Revolution.[1] Anwar wrote that the poet was the\n\"summit of the _Pudjangga Baru_ movement\", considering _Nyanyi Sunyi_ to have\nbeen a \"bright light he [Amir] shone on the new language\";[128] however, Anwar\ndisliked _Buah Rindu_, considering it too classical.[135] Balfas describes\nAmir's works as \"the best literary products to surpass their time\".[136]\nHamzah's work, particularly \"Padamu Jua\", is taught in Indonesian schools. His\n\u0153uvre was also one of the inspirations for Afrizal Malna's 1992 postmodern\nstage play _Biografi Yanti setelah 12 Menit_ (_Biography of Yanti After 12\nMinutes_).[137]\n\nJassin has called Amir the \"King of the Pudjangga Baru-era Poets\", a name he\nused as the title of his book on the poet.[1] In closing his book, Jassin\nwrites:\n\n> Amir was not a leader with a loud voice driving the people, either in his\npoems or his prose. He was a man of emotion, a man of awe, his soul easily\nshaken by the beauty of nature, sadness and joy alternating freely. All his\npoems were imbibed with the breath of love: for nature, for home, for flowers,\nfor a beloved. He longed unendingly, in the most dark of days, for joy, for\n'life with a definite purpose'. Not one poem of struggle, not a single call\nfor empowerment like those which echoed from the other _Poedjangga Baroe_\npoets. But his songs of nature were an intimate permeation of a person whose\nlove for his country was never in doubt.[o]\n\n>\n\n> \u2014\u2009H.B.

Hussein's rule extended through the Cold War and four decades of Arab\u2013Israeli conflict.[2] He recognized Israel in 1994, becoming the second Arab head of state to do so (after Anwar Sadat in 1978/1979).\n\nHussein claimed to be a descendant of the Islamic prophet Muhammad through his\nbelonging to the ancient Hashemite family.[2]\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Early life\n  * 2 Reign\n    * 2.1 Arab Federation of Iraq and Jordan\n    * 2.2 Improving the lives of Jordanians\n    * 2.3 Six-Day War\n    * 2.4 Black September\n    * 2.5 Yom Kippur War\n    * 2.6 Peace with Israel\n      * 2.6.1 Summit of the Peacemakers\n    * 2.7 Hebron Agreement\n    * 2.8 Khaled Mashal assassination attempt\n    * 2.9 Wye River Memorandum\n    * 2.10 Illness\n  * 3 Death\n    * 3.1 Tributes\n  * 4 Personal life\n  * 5 Family\n  * 6 Honours\n  * 7 Bibliography\n  * 8 References\n  * 9 External links\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\nKing Hussein was born in Amman on 14 November 1935 to King Talal bin Abdullah\nand Princess Zein al-Sharaf bint Jamil. After completing his elementary\neducation in Amman, he was educated at Victoria College in Alexandria, Egypt.\nHe proceeded to Harrow School in England, where he befriended his second\ncousin Faisal II of Iraq. He pursued further study at the Royal Military\nAcademy Sandhurst.\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Hussein_bin_Talal_%281\n950%29.jpg/150px-Hussein_bin_Talal_%281950%29.jpg)\n\nHussein bin Talal (1950)\n\nOn 20 July 1951, Prince Hussein traveled to Jerusalem to perform Friday\nprayers at the Al-Aqsa Mosque with his grandfather, King Abdullah I, where a\nPalestinian assassin opened fire on Abdullah and his grandson. Abdullah was\nkilled, but the 15-year-old Hussein survived the assassination attempt, and\naccording to witnesses, pursued the gunman. Witnesses reported that the gunman\nturned his weapon on the young prince, who was saved when the bullet was\ndeflected by a medal on his uniform which had been given to him by his\ngrandfather.[2]\n\nHussein was appointed Crown Prince of Jordan on 9 September 1951. Abdullah's\neldest son, Talal, became King of Jordan, but thirteen months later was forced\nto abdicate owing to his mental state (European and Arab doctors diagnosed\nschizophrenia).[3] King Talal's son, Crown Prince Hussein, was proclaimed King\nof the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan on 11 August 1952, succeeding at the age of\n16. A Regency Council was appointed until he came of age. He was enthroned on\n2 May 1953.[2]\n\n## Reign[edit]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20\n/King_Hussein_in_1955_visit_to_UK_-_Royal_Hasemite_Image.gif)\n\nKing Hussein on a Royal Air Force base in 1955.\n\nIn March 1956, Hussein asserted Jordanian independence by dismissing Glubb\nPasha as the commander of the Jordanian Army, and replacing all the British\nofficers with Jordanians. This now mainly Bedouin army was fiercely loyal to\nhim, due to tribal connections.\n\nHussein's rule was marked by repeated efforts to secure peace in the region.\nMeetings between King Hussein and Israeli foreign ministers Abba Eban and\nGolda Meir began on or before 1963. Jordan, sharing Israel's longest\ncontiguous border, was interested in maintaining a peaceful coexistence with\nIsrael. Avi Shlaim claims that Hussein's intentions \"...throughout the 1960s\nwas to see if there was any way to resolve the dispute with Israel\npeacefully.\"\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Nasser_and_Hussein_at_\n1964_Arab_Summit.jpg/220px-Nasser_and_Hussein_at_1964_Arab_Summit.jpg)\n\nKing Hussein (right) and Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser at the 1964\nArab League Summit in Alexandria, Egypt\n\nKing Hussein sought to understand Israel's position and preferred dialogue to\nthe futility of war. Much of this desire grows out of the threat from other\nArab states, specifically the Ba'athist regimes in Iraq and Syria and Nasser's\nideology of Arab nationalism which had heavily influenced the Army. The first\nsecret meeting took place on 24 September 1963 between King Hussein and Yaacov\nHerzog, a diplomat with wide experience and special emissary of prime minister\nLevi Eshkol.[4] Among other things such as discussions regarding water rights,\nthe purpose of the meetings were to plan and support Israeli and Jordanian\ninitiatives in combating Fatah guerrillas. He would later state \"I told them I\ncould not absorb a serious retaliatory raid, and they accepted the logic of\nthis and promised there would never be one\".[5]\n\nOn 13 November 1966, Israeli military conducted a major incursion into\nJordanian territory, violating their secret agreement with King Hussein, in\nwhat became known as the Samu Incident. Two days later, in response to the\nincident, in a memo to U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson, his Special Assistant\nWalt Rostow wrote: \"retaliation is not the point in this case. This 3,000-man\nraid with tanks and planes was out of all proportion to the provocation and\nwas aimed at the wrong target,\" and went on to describe the damage done to\nU.S. and Israeli interests:\n\n> They've wrecked a good system of tacit cooperation between Hussein and the\nIsraelis. ... They've undercut Hussein. We've spent $500 million to shore him\nup as a stabilizing factor on Israel's longest border and vis-\u00e0-vis Syria and\nIraq. Israel's attack increases the pressure on him to counterattack not only\nfrom the more radical Arab governments and from the Palestinians in Jordan but\nalso from the Army, which is his main source of support and may now press for\na chance to recoup its Sunday losses. ... They've set back progress toward a\nlong term accommodation with the Arabs. ... They may have persuaded the\nSyrians that Israel didn't dare attack Soviet-protected Syria but could attack\nUS-backed Jordan with impunity.[6]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/ACC_stamp_1990_A2.jpg\n/220px-ACC_stamp_1990_A2.jpg)\n\nIraqi stamp about the Arab Cooperation Council (ACC), founded by King Hussein,\nHosni Mubarak of Egypt, Saleh of (North) Yemen and Saddam Hussein of Iraq\n\nPerception of King Hussein's efforts to come to peaceful terms with Israel led\nto great dissatisfaction among some Arab leaders. President Gamal Abdul Nasser\nof Egypt often referred to Hussein as an, \"imperialist lackey\".[7] Army\nCommander-in-Chief General Sharif Zaid Ben Shaker warned in a press conference\nthat \"If Jordan does not join the war a civil war will erupt in Jordan\".[8] In\norder to maintain credibility in the Arab world and maintain stability at\nhome, on 30 May 1967, King Hussein signed a mutual defense treaty with Egypt.\n\n### Arab Federation of Iraq and Jordan[edit]\n\nIn the late 1950s, King Hussein entered Jordan into a joint partnership with\nIraq called the Arab Federation of Iraq and Jordan. The Federation was formed\non 14 February 1958, when King Faisal II of Iraq and his cousin, King Hussein\nof Jordan, sought to unite their two Hashemite kingdoms, as a response to the\nformation of the United Arab Republic. The union lasted only six months, being\nofficially dissolved on 2 August 1958, after Faisal was deposed and\nassassinated by a military coup on 14 July.\n\n### Improving the lives of Jordanians[edit]\n\nEarly on, King Hussein concentrated on building an economic and industrial\ninfrastructure that would improve the quality of life of Jordanians. During\nthe 1960s, Jordan's main industries \u2013 including phosphate, potash and cement \u2013\nwere developed, and a network of highways was built throughout the kingdom.\n\nSocial indicators reflect King Hussein's successes. While in 1950, water,\nsanitation and electricity were available to only 10% of Jordanians, today\nthese reach 99% of the population. In 1960 only 33% of Jordanians were\nliterate, while by 1996, this number had climbed to 85.5%. In 1961, the\naverage Jordanian received a daily intake of 2198 calories, and by 1992, this\nfigure had increased by 37.5% to reach 3022 calories. UNICEF statistics show\nthat between 1981 and 1991, Jordan achieved the world's fastest annual rate of\ndecline in infant mortality \u2013 from 70 deaths per 1000 births in 1981 to 37 per\n1000 in 1991, a fall of over 47%.\n\n### Six-Day War[edit]\n\nMain article: Six-Day War\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Karama_aftermath_1.jpg\n/220px-Karama_aftermath_1.jpg)\n\nKing Hussein after checking an abandoned Israeli tank in the aftermath of the\nBattle of Karameh in 1968\n\nIn June 1967, as a result of what later became known as the Six-Day War,\nJordan lost control of the West Bank and saw its military shattered. In\naddition the country was, for a second time, overrun with many Palestinian\nrefugees. As a result, Palestinian refugees who fled the 1948 and 1967 wars\noutnumbered Jordan's natural citizens. Most refugees were provided citizenship\nby the Jordanian government. Due to their sheer numbers, Palestinian factions\nin Jordan were able to exercise considerable authority, essentially governing\nsome areas of Jordan, leading to many considering them a state within a state,\neroding Hussein's central authority and disturbing the geopolitical stability\nof the Middle East.[9]\n\n### Black September[edit]\n\nMain article: Black September\n\nIn September 1970, Hussein ordered the expulsion of the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization by the Jordanian military. The attacks on Palestinian fighters\nlasted until July 1971, when thousands of Palestinians were expelled, mostly\nfleeing to Lebanon.[10]\n\n### Yom Kippur War[edit]\n\nMain article: Yom Kippur War\n\nAfter the 1967 War and the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 242,\nGunnar Jarring was appointed by the UN as a special envoy for the Middle East\npeace process, leading the Jarring Mission. Both Egypt and Israel responded to\nJarring's proposals with support for a peace process, but the process did not\nmove forward.[11] Egyptian president Anwar Sadat and Syrian president Hafez\nal-Assad met King Hussein in 1973 to discuss the possibility of war. Hussein,\nfearing another loss of territory to Israel, declined. Furthermore, Hussein\nwas suspicious of Sadat's promise to PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat to hand over\nthe West Bank to the Palestinians in the event of a victory, as he considered\nthe West Bank to be Jordanian territory. On the night of 25 September, Hussein\nsecretly flew to Tel Aviv by helicopter to warn Israeli Prime Minister Golda\nMeir of an impending Syrian attack.[12] \"Are (the Syrians) going to war\nwithout the Egyptians, asked Mrs. Meir. The king said he didn't think so. 'I\nthink they [Egypt] would cooperate'\".[13]\n\n![File:King Hussein of Jordan 1980.ogv](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commo\nns/thumb/c/cf/King_Hussein_of_Jordan_1980.ogv/220px--\nKing_Hussein_of_Jordan_1980.ogv.jpg)Play media\n\nKing Hussein meeting Jimmy Carter and being interviewed in 1980\n\nOn 6 October 1973, Syria and Egypt attacked Israel without the aid of Jordan.\nA ceasefire was declared on 23 October, but fighting continued until January\n1974. The Camp David Accords were signed by Egyptian President Anwar El Sadat\nand Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin on 17 September 1978, after 14\nmonths of diplomatic efforts by Egypt, Israel, and the United States.\n\n### Peace with Israel[edit]\n\nMain article: Israel\u2013Jordan Treaty of Peace\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\n/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png) | Wikisource has original text related to this\narticle:\n\n**Hussein of Jordan's Speech at Rabin's Funeral**  \n  \n---|---  \n  \nIn 1994, Hussein concluded negotiations to end the official state of war with\nIsrael resulting in the Israel\u2013Jordan Treaty of Peace which he had begun\nnegotiating in secret with the Israelis in the 1960s. Between 1963 and 1994 he\nhad held at least 55 secret meetings with leading Israelis including at least\nseven prime and foreign ministers.[14]\n\nDue to the close relationship forged with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin\nduring the negotiations of the treaty, Hussein was invited to give a speech\nduring Rabin's funeral.\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Flickr_-\n_Government_Press_Office_%28GPO%29_-\n_PM_Yizhak_Rabin_and_Jordan%27s_King_Hussein_greet_each_other.jpg/220px-\nFlickr_-_Government_Press_Office_%28GPO%29_-\n_PM_Yizhak_Rabin_and_Jordan%27s_King_Hussein_greet_each_other.jpg)\n\nYizhak Rabin and King Hussein greet each other prior to the signing of the\npeace treaty between their countries, 24 October 1994\n\n#### Summit of the Peacemakers[edit]\n\nOn 13 March 1996, the \"Summit of the Peacemakers\" was held at Sharm el-Sheikh,\nEgypt hosted by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. In addition to King Hussein,\nTurkish President S\u00fcleyman Demirel, Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, US\nPresident Bill Clinton, and Russian President Boris Yeltsin were present at\nthe summit. The summit was convened with the expressed aim of putting the\nIsraeli-Palestinian peace process back on track after a period of increased\ntension and hostility.\n\n### Hebron Agreement[edit]\n\nMain article: Hebron Agreement\n\nHussein was often involved in negotiations between the Israelis and\nPalestinians. His 11th-hour intervention in January 1997 is said to have\nbrought Palestinian chairman Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin\nNetanyahu to an agreement on the long-awaited withdrawal of Israeli troops\nfrom most of the West Bank town of Hebron.\n\n### Khaled Mashal assassination attempt[edit]\n\nOn 27 September 1997, the treaty was thrown into jeopardy when two Mossad\nagents attempted to poison Khaled Mashal, who was at the time living in\nJordan. Condemning the attack as a violation of Jordanian sovereignty, King\nHussein threatened to void the treaty if Mashal died. Jordanian doctors\ndetermined and administered the proper antidote in time, just as Israeli Prime\nMinister Benjamin Netanyahu bowed to international pressure and ordered Mossad\nto hand it over. Mashal recovered, and relations between Jordan and Israel\nthawed.[15]\n\n### Wye River Memorandum[edit]\n\nMain article: Wye River Memorandum\n\nIn October 1998 U.S. President Bill Clinton invited Hussein, who was in the US\nundergoing chemotherapy treatment for cancer, to attend the Wye Plantation\ntalks. Hussein received a standing ovation at the ceremony and praise from\nClinton.[_citation needed_]\n\n### Illness[edit]\n\nAt the end of July 1998, it was made public that Hussein was diagnosed with\nlymphatic cancer by doctors at the Mayo Clinic. Hussein's lymphoma was of a\ntype that responded to chemotherapy, which the King had already begun and his\nphysicians were optimistic he could be cured. Speaking on Jordanian television\nvia satellite, Hussein reassured the Jordanian people that the cancer was\ncurable. Nevertheless, he looked fragile and pale. It was the 62-year-old\nmonarch's second bout with cancer; he lost a kidney to the disease in\n1992.[16]\n\nOn his way back to Jordan in January 1999, Hussein stopped in London.[17]\nDoctors advised him to rest and stay in England for a few weeks, as he was\nstill too fragile to travel. According to Jordanian government sources,\nHussein stated that:\n\n    \n\n    \"I need very much to feel the warmth of my people around me, there is work to be done and I will get the strength from my people to finish the business.\"[18]\n\nUpon returning to Jordan Hussein was greeted by family members, ministers,\nparliament members, foreign dignitaries and crowds of Jordanian citizens,\nestimated by Jordanian government officials at 3 million.[9]\n\n## Death[edit]\n\nMain article: Death and state funeral of King Hussein\n\nJust before his death, Hussein made a change to his will revising the law of\nsuccession, which earlier had designated his brother Hassan successor, in\nfavour of his eldest son Abdullah. He abruptly returned to the U.S. clinic on\n25 January 1999 for further treatment undergoing a failed bone marrow\ntransplant after which he returned to Jordan.\n\nOn 7 February 1999, King Hussein died of complications related to non-\nHodgkin's lymphoma. He was, at the time of his death, one of the longest-\nserving leaders in international politics.[2] He had been the King of Jordan\nfor over 46 years, during which he was an important actor in various Middle\nEast conflicts. Just prior to his death, during an interview with CNN's\nChristiane Amanpour, Hussein expressed his opinion that a peaceful resolution\nwould eventually be reached in the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict.[19]\n\nKing Hussein's funeral was held on 8 February 1999 in the presence of all five\nof his sons, foreign dignitaries and statesmen, and an estimated 800,000\nJordanians.[20][21] The UN General Assembly held an Emergency Special Session\nin \"Tribute to the Memory of His Majesty the King of Jordan\" on the same\nday.[22]\n\nKing Hussein was succeeded as king by his eldest son Abdullah II of Jordan.\n\n### Tributes[edit]\n\n  * \"He won the respect and admiration of the entire world and so did his beloved Jordan. He is a man who believed that we are all God's children, bound to live together in mutual respect and tolerance.\" (U.S. President Bill Clinton)[23]\n  * \"He was an extraordinary and immensely charismatic persuader for peace. At the peace talks in America when he was extremely ill, he was there, talking to both sides, urging them forward, telling them nothing must stand in the way of peace.\" (UK Prime Minister Tony Blair)[23]\n  * \"President Yasser Arafat and the Palestinian people and leadership have received with great sorrow and pain the news,\" it said in a statement. (The Palestinian Authority)\n  * \"He was a generous brother and a dear friend,\" said a statement. (Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.)\n  * South African President Nelson Mandela believed the death would be \"deeply mourned by all peace-loving people.\"\n  * UN Secretary General Kofi Annan paid tribute to the late king, praising him for his \"lifelong struggle to bring peace\".\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\nHussein was an enthusiastic ham radio operator and an Honorary Member of The\nRadio Society of Harrow and a life member of the American Radio Relay League\n(ARRL)[24] [25] (callsign JY1). Hussein was popular in the amateur radio\ncommunity and insisted that fellow operators refer to him without his title.\n\nHussein was a trained pilot, flying both airplanes and helicopters as a hobby.\nIn a 1999 interview Henry Kissinger described being flown by Hussein, saying\nthat \"...he was a daring pilot, and he would be zooming along at treetop\nlevel, and my wife, in order to be politely insistent would say, \"You know I\ndidn't know helicopters could fly so low\" \"Oh!\" said the king, \"They can fly\nlower!\" and went below tree top level just skimming along on the ground. That\nreally aged me rapidly.\"[26]\n\nHussein was also a collector of motorcycles.[26] The cover of the paperback\nversion of Queen Noor's book _Leap of Faith: Memoirs of an Unexpected Life_\nfeatures a photo of the King and Queen riding a Harley-Davidson motorcycle.\n\n## Family[edit]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-\nQuestion_book-new.svg.png)\n\n| This section **does not cite any sources**.

The escapade ended in Georgetown, British Guiana, with the arrest of the\ntrawler's captain, George \"Dod\" Orsborne. On 1 April 1936, Orsborne, with a\ncrew of four, took the vessel out on what its owners authorised as a routine\nNorth Sea fishing trip. Nothing was heard of them until mid-May, when the\nowners received invoices relating to repairs and reprovisioning in the Spanish\nport of Corcubi\u00f3n. Subsequent sightings placed the trawler in the Savage\nIslands, at Dakar in Senegal, and at \u00celes du Salut off the coast of French\nGuiana in South America. After the vessel's capture and detention on 19 June,\nthe crew were hailed as heroes by much of the world's press. Orsborne returned\nto England and was tried and imprisoned for the theft of the vessel. Years\nlater he made an uncorroborated claim that the _Girl Pat_ voyage had been an\nundercover mission carried out on behalf of British Naval Intelligence.\n(**Full\u00a0article...**)\n\n  * Recently featured: \n\n    * _Regents of the University of California v.

Mexican troops\nsurprised rebellious colonists from the Mexican province of Texas, primarily\nimmigrants from the United States, known as Texians. By the end of 1835,\nTexians had expelled all Mexican troops from their province. In February Frank\nW. Johnson, the commander of the volunteer army in Texas, along with James\nGrant, was leading a planned invasion of the Mexican port town of Matamoros.\nUnbeknownst to the Texians, Mexican General Jos\u00e9 de Urrea was leading troops\nfrom Matamoros into Texas to neutralize the rebels gathered along the coast.\nHis troops easily defeated Johnson's small force on February 26. Several days\nlater, informants revealed the location of another small force led by Grant,\nand on the morning of March\u00a02, Urrea sent 150 troops who ambushed and defeated\nthem. Grant fled but was killed, as were 11 men under his command. Six Texians\nwere taken prisoner, and Urrea jailed them instead of executing them, contrary\nto Santa Anna's orders. Another six Texians escaped, five of whom later died\nin the Goliad Massacre.

It was the first\nMetallica album released on a major label, and the last to feature bassist\nCliff Burton, who died in a bus crash in Sweden during the album's promotional\ntour. It was recorded at the Sweet Silence Studios with producer Flemming\nRasmussen. _Master of Puppets_ received critical acclaim for its atmospheric\nand meticulous approach to American thrash metal, and has been included in\nseveral publications' best album lists. Its driving music and angry, political\nlyrics drew praise from critics outside the metal community. The album is\nconsidered the band's strongest effort of the period, and remains one of the\nmost influential heavy metal albums. It peaked at number 29 on the _Billboard_\n200 and became the first thrash metal album to be certified platinum. In 2003\nthe Recording Industry Association of America certified at least six million\ncopies shipped, and in 2012 Music Canada certified 600,000 copies.

Usually gray or black, Percherons are well muscled, and known for their\nintelligence and willingness to work. Ancestors of the breed were present in\nHuisne by the 17th century, and were originally bred to be war horses. Over\ntime, they were used for farm work, pulling stage coaches, and hauling heavy\ngoods. The first purebred Percheron stud book was created in France in 1883.\nIn the late 19th century, thousands of Percherons were shipped from France to\nthe US, but after World War I began, some were shipped back to France to help\nin the fighting. In 1918 breeding of Percherons began in Great Britain and the\nBritish Percheron Horse Society was formed. The current US Percheron registry\nwas created in 1934. Their numbers declined substantially after World War II,\nbut later rebounded. The breed is still used today for riding, for pulling\ncarriages and for heavier draft work. They have been crossed with light horse\nbreeds to produce horses for a wide range of uses.

It was McCay's second successful strip, after _Little Sammy\nSneeze_ secured him a position on the cartoon staff of the _New York Herald_.\n_Rarebit Fiend_ was printed in the _Evening Telegram_, a newspaper published\nby the _Herald_. The strip had no continuity or recurring characters. Instead,\nit had a recurring theme: a character would have a nightmare or other bizarre\ndream, usually after eating a Welsh rarebit\u2014a cheese-on-toast dish. The dreams\noften revealed unflattering sides of the dreamers' psyches\u2014their phobias,\nhypocrisies, discomforts, and dark fantasies. The strip is mostly recognized\nas an adult-oriented precursor to McCay's signature strip, _Little Nemo_. The\npopularity of _Rarebit Fiend_ and _Nemo_ led to a job with William Randolph\nHearst's chain of newspapers with a star's salary.

After the war he studied physics at the University of Cambridge under Ernest Rutherford. He remained in the Militia between the wars, and was a major general by the time the Second World War broke out. He commanded the 6th Division through the Australian Army's first battles of the war. During the Battle of Bardia in 1941, the 6th Division captured the fortified town along with 36,000 Italian prisoners; Mackay was knighted for this success. In the Battle of Greece, he became the only Australian general to face the _Waffen-SS_ in battle. He was recalled to Australia in 1941, commanding the Home Forces and New Guinea Force as a lieutenant general. His active service ended in 1943 with his appointment as High Commissioner to India.

Iron Age hill forts and Roman villas were built near the confluence of the Rivers Frome and Avon, and around the beginning of the 11th century the settlement was known as Brycgstow (Old English for \"the place at the bridge\"). Bristol received a royal charter in 1155, and became a county in 1373. A major commercial port from the 12th century, it was the starting place for early voyages of exploration to the New World, including the 1497 expedition in which John Cabot became the first European since the Vikings to land on mainland North America. One of the top four English cities in tax receipts from the 13th to the 18th century, Bristol's prominence declined during the Industrial Revolution. Its modern economy is built on the creative media, electronics and aerospace industries. The city-centre docks closed in the 20th century, and have been redeveloped as centres of heritage and culture. The city is among the most popular tourist destinations in the UK.

In 1936 she was a leader of the Jarrow March, an iconic symbol of 1930s unemployment and impoverishment. On graduating from the University of Manchester in 1913, Wilkinson worked mainly as a trade union official, and was briefly a member of the British Communist Party before becoming Labour MP for Middlesbrough East in 1924. After losing her seat in the 1931 general election she worked as a writer and journalist before resuming her parliamentary career in 1935. A strong advocate for the Republican faction in the Spanish Civil War, she made several visits to the battle zones. During the Second World War Wilkinson served in Churchill's wartime coalition as a junior minister. By the time she achieved cabinet office in Clement Attlee's postwar Labour ministry she was in poor health due to constant overwork, and was able to promote only modest educational reforms.

It was the home of Everton F.C. from 1884 until a rent dispute in 1891, and has been the home of Liverpool F.C. since their formation in 1892. The stadium has four stands: the Spion Kop, Main Stand, Centenary Stand and Anfield Road. The record attendance of 61,905 was set at a match between Liverpool and Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1952. The ground was reduced to an all-seater stadium in 1994 on the recommendation of the Taylor Report. It has two gates named after the former Liverpool managers Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley, with a statue of Shankly at the visitors' centre outside. The ground is 2 miles (3\u00a0km) from Liverpool Lime Street railway station. A proposal in 2002 to replace the stadium with a new one in the adjacent Stanley Park was rejected by Fenway Sports Group, who acquired the club in 2010.

During this period of great wealth and cultural achievement when Dutch painting became highly popular, his father and uncle were also landscape artists. His earliest works, dating from 1646, show remarkable quality for his age. He moved from his Haarlem birthplace to Amsterdam around 1657, where he lived until his death. Ruisdael painted a wide variety of landscape subjects, including Dutch countryside scenes, city panoramas, seascapes, and Scandinavian waterfalls. The sky often takes up two thirds of the canvas. His accurate rendering of trees was unprecedented, and he is particularly known for his paintings of mills, such as _Windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede_ _(pictured)_. Ruisdael shaped landscape painting traditions worldwide, influencing the English Romantics, the French Barbizon School, and the American Hudson River School, as well as generations of Dutch landscape artists. The National Gallery, the Rijksmuseum, and the Hermitage Museum hold the largest collections of his paintings.

Born into an aristocratic Malay family in the Sultanate of Langkat, Sumatra, he began writing poetry while still a teenager. Though his works are undated, the earliest are from around 1930, when he first travelled to Java for schooling. He continued writing while studying in Surakarta and Batavia. He helped establish the literary magazine _Poedjangga Baroe_ in 1932, and published his two poetry collections in it, _Nyanyi Sunyi_ (1937) and _Buah Rindu_ (1941). Amir stopped writing in 1937, when he grudgingly returned to Sumatra to marry the sultan's daughter and take on responsibilities of the court. After Indonesia proclaimed its independence in 1945, he served as the government's representative in Langkat; the following year he was killed in a socialist revolution and buried in a mass grave. His poetry deals with themes of love and religion, and often reflects a deep inner conflict. He has been called the \"King of the Poedjangga Baroe-era Poets\" and the only international-class Indonesian poet from before the Indonesian National Revolution.

The animals lived for at least 12 to 20 years, but the\nmaximum life span is not known.

The name of this most horrible of all the demons of\nthe Scottish islands may be a progenitor of that by which the Devil is\nsometimes known, Old Nick. Though accounts describing the creature's\nappearance are inconsistent, its abilities are well-documented. The\nnuckelavee's breath can wilt crops and sicken livestock, and the creature has\nbeen held responsible for droughts and epidemics on land despite its being\npredominantly a sea-dweller. In common with many other sea monsters, it is\nunable to tolerate fresh water; therefore, those it is pursuing have only to\ncross a river or stream to be rid of it. The nuckelavee is kept in confinement\nduring the summer months by the Mither o' the Sea, an ancient Orcadian divine\nand the only one able to control it. This mythological creature may have\noriginated as a composite of a water horse from Celtic mythology and a\ncreature imported by Norsemen.

Robert\nOppenheimer. He had headed the Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II,\nwhere he played a key part in the Manhattan Project that developed the atomic\nbomb. Doubts about Oppenheimer's loyalty dated back to the 1930s, when he was\nassociated with Communist Party USA members, including his wife and his\nbrother. At Los Alamos and in the AEC, he was involved in bureaucratic\nconflict between the Army and Air Force over the types of nuclear weapons the\ncountry required, technical conflict between the scientists over the\nfeasibility of the hydrogen bomb, and personal conflict with AEC commissioner\nLewis Strauss. The panel found that he was loyal and discreet with atomic\nsecrets, but did not recommend that his security clearance be reinstated. This\nended his role in government and policymaking. He became an academic exile,\ncut off from his former career and the world he had helped to create. The\nfindings were seen as fair by some and as an expression of anti-Communist\nMcCarthyism by others.

The name comes from Western Cree words for muddy or brackish water, referring to Lake Winnipeg, which is just north of the city along the Red River. The region was a trading centre for aboriginal peoples long before the arrival of Europeans. French traders built the first fort on the site in 1738. A settlement was later founded by the Selkirk settlers of the Red River Colony in 1812, the nucleus of which was incorporated as the City of Winnipeg in 1873. In the census figures of 2011, Winnipeg was the seventh most populous municipality in Canada. Known as the \"Gateway to the West\", it is a transportation hub with a diversified economy. Its annual festivals include the Festival du Voyageur, the Winnipeg Folk Festival, the Jazz Winnipeg Festival, the Winnipeg Fringe Theatre Festival, and Folklorama. Winnipeg was the first Canadian host of the Pan American Games. It is home to several professional sports franchises, including the Winnipeg Blue Bombers (Canadian football), Winnipeg Jets (ice hockey), Manitoba Moose (ice hockey) and Winnipeg Goldeyes (baseball).

Translated to \"Christ lay in death's bonds\" _(pictured in an 18th-century Luther Bible)_, it is one of his earliest church cantatas, a genre to which Bach later contributed complete cantata cycles for all occasions of the liturgical year. The composition was probably intended for a performance in 1707, supporting his application for a post at a church in M\u00fchlhausen. Both text and music are based on Martin Luther's Easter hymn of the same name. An opening sinfonia is followed by seven chorale variations _per omnes versus_: Bach used in each vocal movement the unchanged words and tune of a stanza of the chorale. The variations are arranged symmetrically: chorus\u2013duet\u2013solo\u2013chorus\u2013solo\u2013duet\u2013chorus, with the focus on the central fourth stanza about the battle between Life and Death. For his first Easter as _Thomaskantor_ in Leipzig in 1724, Bach used the cantata again, and also for the following year as part of his cycle of chorale cantatas. In the extant score of the Leipzig performances, the four vocal parts are sometimes reinforced by a choir of trombones.

15-hour military\nengagement between the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and combined forces of the\nPalestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Jordanian Armed Forces (JAF)\nin the Jordanian town of Karameh on 21 March 1968, during the War of\nAttrition.[4] It was planned by Israel as two concurrent raids on PLO camps,\none in Karameh and one in the distant village of Safi\u2014codenamed **Operation\nInferno** (Hebrew: \u05de\u05d1\u05e6\u05e2 \u05ea\u05d5\u05e4\u05ea\u200e) and **Operation Asuta** (\u05de\u05d1\u05e6\u05e2 \u05d0\u05e1\u05d5\u05ea\u05d0),\nrespectively\u2014but the former turned into a full-scale battle.[15]\n\nAfter the Six-Day War in 1967, the PLO and Fatah started to step up their\nguerrilla attacks against Israel from Jordanian soil taking the border town of\nKarameh as their headquarters.[4] The battle started with an Israeli invasion\nthat was intended to destroy Palestinian groups' camps at Karameh and capture\nYasser Arafat in reprisal for the attacks by the PLO.[16] However, plans for\nthe two operations were prepared in 1967, one year before the bus incident.[5]\nIt is also believed that Israel wanted to punish Jordan for its support to the\nPLO.[17] When Jordan saw the size of the raiding forces entering the battle it\nwas lead to the assumption that Israel had another goal of capturing Balqa\nGovernorate to create a Golan Heights similar situation.[18][19] Israel\nassumed that the Jordanian Army would ignore the invasion, but the latter\nfought alongside the Palestinians and opened heavy fire that inflicted losses\nupon the Israeli forces.[20] This engagement marked the first known deployment\nof suicide bombers by Palestinian forces.[21] The Israelis were repelled at\nthe end of a day's battle, having destroyed most of the Karameh camp and taken\naround 141 PLO prisoners.[3] The battle resulted in the issuance of the United\nNations Security Council Resolution 248, which condemned Israel for violating\nthe cease-fire line.[22]\n\nBoth sides declared victory. On a tactical level, the battle went in Israel's\nfavor[13] and the destruction of the Karameh camp was achieved.[9] However,\nthe relatively high casualties were a considerable surprise for the Israel\nDefense Forces and was stunning to the Israelis.[4] On a rare occasion, Israel\nin this battle was unable to retrieve three dead soldiers who were left behind\nin Karameh along with several damaged Israeli vehicles and tanks, later\nparaded in Amman by the Jordanians.[23] Although the Palestinians were not\nvictorious on their own, King Hussein let the Palestinians take credit.[24]\nThe Palestinians used this to establish their national claims.[25] King\nHussein after the battle proclaimed, \"I think we may reach a position where we\nare all fedayeen.\" However, afterwards the PLO's strength began to grow, and\nPalestinians spoke openly of taking over Jordan. This situation eventually led\nto Black September in Jordan, in 1970.[20]\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Background\n  * 2 Prelude\n  * 3 Battle\n    * 3.1 Casualties\n  * 4 Aftermath\n  * 5 Historiography\n    * 5.1 Israeli historiography\n    * 5.2 Jordanian and Palestinian historiography\n  * 6 Bibliography\n  * 7 References\n  * 8 External links\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/South_jordan_valley.pn\ng/220px-South_jordan_valley.png)\n\nBridges over the Jordan River\n\nFollowing the seizure of the West Bank from Jordan in the June 1967 Six-Day\nWar, Israel destroyed the existing Palestinian group Fatah networks there. In\nearly 1968, however, Fatah guerrillas began raiding Israel from bases on the\nJordanian side of the river. Most of these attacks were blocked by the Israel\nDefense Forces. At times, Jordanian Army infantry and artillery units gave the\nFatah squads covering fire, leading to frequent direct skirmishes between the\nIDF and the Jordanian Army.[4] On 14\u201315 February, Jordanian mortars hit\nseveral Israeli settlements in the Beit Shean Valley and Jordan Valley.\nIsraeli artillery and air forces retaliated against Jordanian bases and\nartillery batteries, as well as the American-financed East Ghor Canal (now\nknown as the King Abdullah Canal). As a result, thousands of Jordanian farmers\nfled eastwards, and fedayeen (agents willing to sacrifice themselves for the\nPalestinian cause) moved into the valley. An American-sponsored ceasefire was\narranged, and King Hussein declared he would prevent these groups from using\nJordan as a base for attack.[26]\n\nIn February, King Hussein sent twenty carloads of troops and police to order a\nFatah unit to leave the town of Karameh. When it arrived, the column found\nitself surrounded by men wielding machine guns; their commander said \"You have\nthree minutes to decide whether you leave or die\". They withdrew.[27] By\nMarch, several hundred civilians lived in the camp, along with about 900\nguerrillas, mostly from Fatah, and PLO leader Yasser Arafat, who had his\nheadquarters there.[7]\n\nIn Israel, Chief of the Military Intelligence Directorate Aharon Yariv stated\nthat a raid would damage Fatah's prestige. On the other hand, Israeli Foreign\nMinister Abba Eban and his chief of bureau Gideon Rafael \u2014 mindful of an\nadverse American reaction due to the good relationship between Jordan and the\nUS \u2014 worried a raid could result in innocent civilian deaths and be a\npolitical disservice to Israel. Chief of Staff Haim Bar-Lev promised a \"clean\naction\". Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Dayan asked for a \"principal approval\"\nfor a raid, but this was denied by the cabinet. On December 13, Operation\nKarameh was scheduled for the next night , it was placed in the hands of both\nBrigade 35 of the Paratroop Corps and the Sayeret Matkal special-operations\nforce. The operation was called off, rescheduled for March 12 and then called\noff again.[5] Dayan warned the other ministers that a bus might strike a\nmine.[28] On 18 March, an Israeli school bus was blown up by a mine near Be'er\nOra in the Arava, killing two adults and wounding ten children.[7] This was\nthe 38th Fatah operation in little more than three months.[20] That night, the\ncabinet approved the attack. The U.S. tried to prevent it by forwarding Israel\na message from King Hussein. Israeli Prime Minister Levi Eshkol called in the\ncabinet for further counseling; only the National Religious Party leader Haim-\nMoshe Shapira vocally opposed the attack, while Education Minister Zalman Aran\nopposed it too but remained silent.[28] There was an intelligence informant\nwho was a former Fatah member, code-named \"Grotius\" who was said to be\nfamiliar with the base in Karameh and its surroundings. Grotius is said to\nhave arrived in Jordan as a member of the 421st Commando Battalion of the\nPalestine Liberation Army, on the eve of the Six-Day War. After deserting his\nbattalion, he trained in Syria at the Hama camp and later slipped into the\nWest Bank.[5] Israel assumed that the Jordanians would ignore the invasion,\nhowever, the Israelis were met with heavy resistance from them.[20]\n\n## Prelude[edit]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/%D7%92%D7%A9%D7%A8_%D7\n%90%D7%93%D7%9D.JPG/220px-%D7%92%D7%A9%D7%A8_%D7%90%D7%93%D7%9D.JPG)\n\nView of Damia Bridge\n\nOn March 4, Jordanian intelligence began to detect Israeli activity near the\nborder, as IDF troops began to concentrate near the Allenby Bridge (known now\nas King Hussein Bridge) and Damia Bridge (known now as Adam Bridge). Jordan\nordered the 1st Infantry Division to take up positions near those bridges and\naround Karameh.[29] On March 17, Dayan warned that the fedayeen were preparing\nfor a \"new wave of terror,\" which Israel would take steps to contain if King\nHussein of Jordan could not. Eshkol repeated that message to the Knesset, and\non the same day, Israeli Ambassador Yosef Tekoah filed two complaints with the\nUnited Nations against what he termed \"the Arabs' repeated acts of\naggression.\"[30]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Arafat_in_Lebanon.jpg\n/220px-Arafat_in_Lebanon.jpg)\n\nYasser Arafat _(right)_ in 1977\n\nBy March 20, Jordan had identified parts of the Israeli 7th Armored Brigade,\n60th Armored Brigade, 35th Paratroop Brigade, 80th Infantry Brigade, a combat\nengineer battalion and five artillery battalions between Allenby and Damia\nbridges. The Jordanians assumed the Israelis were planning an attack with a\ndrive on Amman, and the army took up positions near the bridges, with the 60th\nArmored Brigade joining the 1st Infantry Division. Jordan also added most of\nits armored car, antitank and artillery units to the 1st Infantry Division.\nThe total firepower was 105 Patton tanks and 88 artillery pieces. The infantry\ndivisions were deployed near the bridges, each with a tank company. The\nartillery was mostly deployed on the higher Jordan Valley ridges overlooking\nKarameh for topological advantage.[29]\n\nThe Israeli forces amounted to less than a brigade of armor, an infantry\nbrigade, a paratroop battalion, an engineering battalion and five battalions\nof artillery. The units were divided into four task forces. The largest of\nthese was to cross the Allenby Bridge and reach Karameh from the south; a\nsecond one was to cross the Damiyah Bridge, and reach Karameh from the north,\nthus completing a pincer move. Meanwhile, paratroopers were to be lifted by\nhelicopters into the town while the fourth force would make a diversionary\nattack at King Abdullah Bridge to draw the Jordanian forces from Karameh and\nto cover the main attack.[29]\n\nPrior to the attack, the Israeli Air Force (IAF) dropped leaflets telling the\nJordanian army that Israel had no intention to hurt them, and that they should\nnot intervene;[31] the leaflets went unheeded. Time magazine reported the\nfedayeen had been warned in advance by Egyptian intelligence, and most of the\n2,000 Arab commandos who used Karameh as a training base had pulled back into\nthe surrounding hills to snipe at the Israelis. Some 200 guerrillas stayed\ninside to defend the town.[30] Later, Arafat's deputy, Abu Iyad, claimed in\nhis memoirs that he and Arafat had been tipped off about the Israeli attack by\nJordanian officers, who learned it from the CIA.[32]\n\n## Battle[edit]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Karame_battle.png\n/220px-Karame_battle.png)\n\nMap showing the Jordanian positions (green) and the Israeli advance (blue)\n\nAt 5:30\u00a0AM on March 21, the Israeli forces attacked simultaneously on the\nthree bridges.[33] Combat engineers built a pontoon bridge in the north and\nthe troops crossed the river. The Israeli spearheads pushed across the Allenby\nBridge and advanced towards Shunat Nimreen.[34]\n\nAt 6:30\u00a0AM, Israeli helicopters started landing the bulk of the paratrooper\nbattalion north of Karameh.[35] An Israeli aircraft was supposed to drop\nleaflets addressed to Fatah, after the paratroopers had surrounded the town;\nhowever, due to difficult weather conditions, the helicopters flying the\nparatroopers arrived twenty minutes too late. Met with resistance by Fatah\ncommandos and Jordanian regulars supported by Jordanian artillery, the\nparatroopers suffered heavy losses.[36] When the southern task force began\ntheir drive north towards Karameh, they encountered a Jordanian infantry\nbrigade supported by armor, artillery and antitank weapons. The Israeli Air\nForce launched airstrikes, but was only able to inflict minor damage on the\ndug-in Jordanians. Fighting from their entrenched positions, the Jordanians\nrepelled several Israeli assaults.[34]\n\nIn the south, Jordanian artillery shelling prevented the Israelis from\nerecting another pontoon bridge on the site of the Abdullah bridge, halting\nthe Israeli advance there.[8] After crossing the Allenby Bridge, the 7th\nArmored Brigade spread in three directions from Shuna: One or more companies\ndrove north to Karameh. An infantry battalion and a tank battalion moved east\nto block the Salt road. And another infantry battalion moved south to assist\nthe force trying to break across the Abdullah Bridge.[2] Meanwhile, the force\nthat crossed the Damia Bridge established itself on the east bank. Engineers\nbegan constructing a new bridge, and the force advanced east to the Musri\njunction. After taking Musri, their intended advance south to Karameh was\nrepulsed by the northern brigade of the Jordanian 1st Division.[2]\n\nThe force driving on Karameh via the Allenby bridge broke through and\nproceeded to the town, arriving shortly before 7:00.[10] By 8:00 the Israeli\nforces had taken control of the town, which turned out to be a bigger PLO base\nthan the Israelis expected.[37] Combined with the paratroopers, this Israeli\nforce engaged in heavy fighting against the central brigade of the 1st\ndivision and a number of Fatah fighters. Some of the paratroopers and armor\ndrove north to operate in the Fatah camp. The paratroopers destroyed most of\nthe camp; many of the Palestinians, including Arafat, fled eastward.[2] The\nrest of the Allenby Bridge force was blocked to the east and south of Shuna,\nby elements of the 1st Division's central and southern brigades, and by a tank\nbattalion from Salt.[35] A small force of Israeli infantry and armor, on the\nright flank of Israeli forces invading from the south, tried to protect the\nallenby bridge force from attacks by the Jordanian forces deployed near the\nKing Abdullah bridge. The Jordanians attacked with some armor, but the\nIsraelis put up resistance, and the battle turned into a stalemate.[10]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Karama_Battle_4.jpg\n/220px-Karama_Battle_4.jpg)\n\nJordanian artillery battery at Karameh, 21 March 1968\n\nA large force of Israeli infantry and armor went east to block the road from\nSalt to the Allenby bridge, and they encountered the Jordanian 60th Armored\nBrigade trying to join the defense of Karameh. In the resulting battle, the\nJordanians lost eight Patton tanks without destroying any Israeli tanks, then\nwithdrew to the hills to dig in and continue firing down on the Israelis.[10]\nThe Israeli Air Force launched airstrikes against Jordanian armor and\nartillery positions, but was unable to stop the firing.[2] Within the next two\nhours, Israeli artillery fire and airstrikes were launched against Jordanian\ndefenses on the Musri-Karameh road, the Salt road, and east of Abdullah\nBridge. The Israelis also consolidated their hold on Karameh with airstrikes\nand artillery, and began demolishing the camp.[38] A total of 175 houses were\nblown up.[10]\n\nMeanwhile, Operation Asuta was mounted against a few smaller guerrilla bases\nsouth of the Dead Sea, near Safi, where the school bus had struck the mine.\nThe bases were raided by Israeli ground forces with close air support. About\n20 Jordanian soldiers and policemen and 20 Fatah fighters were killed, and 27\nwere taken prisoner. The Israelis suffered no casualties.[10] Frustrated in\ntheir hope to entrap the entire PLO force, the Israelis soon pulled out, but\nhad to fight their way back to Israeli territory.[30] At 11:00 the Israelis\nbegan to withdraw, with Sikorsky H-34 helicopters evacuating the troops.[31]\nBecause orders came down to recover as many vehicles as possible, they only\ncompleted their withdrawal by 20:40.[8] They had planned a rescue for its two\ntanks which were left in Jordan, but later withdrew the plan.[5]\n\n### Casualties[edit]\n\nSee also: Israeli casualties of war and Palestinian casualties of war\n\n  * ![Karama aftermath 2.jpg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Karama_aftermath_2.jpg/271px-Karama_aftermath_2.jpg)\n\n  * ![Karama aftermath 3.jpg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Karama_aftermath_3.jpg/275px-Karama_aftermath_3.jpg)\n\n  * ![Karama aftermath 4.jpg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Karama_aftermath_4.jpg/249px-Karama_aftermath_4.jpg)\n\n  * ![Karama aftermath 7.jpg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Karama_aftermath_7.jpg/263px-Karama_aftermath_7.jpg)\n\n  * ![King Hussein - Battle of Karameh.jpg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/King_Hussein_-_Battle_of_Karameh.jpg/248px-King_Hussein_-_Battle_of_Karameh.jpg)\n\n  * ![Karama aftermath 8.jpg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Karama_aftermath_8.jpg/243px-Karama_aftermath_8.jpg)\n\nJordanian soldiers surrounding Israeli abandoned or destroyed trucks and tanks\nwhich were paraded across Amman and were put on display at the Hashemite\nPlaza.[39]\n\nCasualties estimates vary:\n\n  * **Israel**: Chaim Herzog and Kenneth Pollack estimate 28 dead and 69 wounded;[37][40] Shabtai Teveth gives 32 killed and 70 wounded out of a force of 1,000 soldiers.[41] Benny Morris writes that Israel lost 33 dead and 161 wounded.[10] 27 Israeli tanks were damaged by Jordanian artillery, 4 of which were left behind, two half-tracks, six armored cars and Dassault Ouragan aircraft,[40] although the pilot succeeded in parachuting to safety.[37] A Mirage had to crash land.[10]\n  * **Jordan**: Zeev Maoz and Benny Morris cite a figure of some 84 Jordanian soldiers killed and another 250 wounded. Four were captured. 30 tanks were damaged. Other estimates claim 40 dead and 108 wounded.[13]\n  * **PLO**: Herzog: 200 dead, 150 captured; Morris: 156 dead, 141 captured;[10] Pollack: 100 dead, 100 wounded, 120\u2013150 captured.[40] According to Morris, a further 20 PLO guerillas were killed and 27 captured during the corresponding Operation Asuta. Teveth states 170 killed and 130 taken prisoner.[10]\n\n## Aftermath[edit]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Karama_aftermath_6.JPG\n/220px-Karama_aftermath_6.JPG)\n\nAftermath in Karameh.\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Karama_aftermath_5.jpg\n/220px-Karama_aftermath_5.jpg)\n\nAftermath in Karameh.\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Memorial_to_Jordanian_\nsoldiers_%28Karameh%2C_Jordan%29.jpg/220px-\nMemorial_to_Jordanian_soldiers_%28Karameh%2C_Jordan%29.jpg)\n\nA monument in Karameh commemorating the Jordanian fighters\n\nIsrael accomplished its objective of destroying the Fatah camp,[37][42] and on\na tactical level, the battle did indeed end in Israel's favor.[13] \"The Karama\noperation exposed the vulnerability of PLO units deployed along the Jordan\nRiver and so they moved their concentrations up into the mountains. This\nimposed additional strains on them and made their operations into the West\nBank even more involved and difficult than they had been hitherto.\"[9]\nPolitically however, Israel was heavily condemned by the world opinion. U.S.\nAmbassador to the UN, Arthur Goldberg, said \"We believe that the military\ncounteractions such as those which have just taken place, on a scale out of\nproportion to the acts of violence that preceded it, are greatly to be\ndeplored.\"[30] US Ambassador to Israel, Walworth Barbour, said that in twenty\nyears time, a historian would write that day down as the beginning of the\ndestruction of Israel. Eban reported the Ambassabor's statement to the\ncabinet, and Menachem Begin said such an utterance must not be cited in a\ncabinet meeting.[28]\n\nThe relatively high casualties were a considerable surprise for the IDF and\nwas stunning to the Israelis.[4] Although the Palestinians were not victorious\non their own, King Hussein let the Palestinians take credit.[43][24] However,\nthe battle of Karameh provided Fatah with a propaganda boost.[28] The chief of\nbureau of the then Israeli Foreign ministry Gideon Rafael later said that \"The\noperation gave an enormous lift to Yasser Arafat's Fatah organization and\nirrevocably implanted the Palestine problem onto the international agenda, no\nlonger as a humanitarian issue of homeless refugees, but as a claim to\nPalestinian statehood\".[25] Uzi Narkis, who commanded the operation, resigned\nas chief of the Central Command for a position in the Jewish Agency shortly\nafter the battle.[15]\n\nJordan claimed to have won the battle and stopped an Israeli drive on Balqa\nGovernorate in intentions of occupying it and turning into a security buffer\nzone, which was supposed to serve as a punishment, due to the Jordanian\nsupport to the PLO. The Jordanians made this assumption as they saw the size\nof the raiding Israeli forces entering the battle.[44] Arafat said \"What we\nhave done is to make the world\u00a0... realize that the Palestinian is no longer\nrefugee number so and so, but the member of a people who hold the reins of\ntheir own destiny and are in a position to determine their own future\".[25]\nPalestinians and Arabs generally considered the battle a psychological victory\nover the IDF, which had been seen as 'invincible' until then, and recruitment\nto guerilla units soared.[45] Fatah reported that 5,000 volunteers applied to\njoin within 48 hours of the battle.[25] By late March, there were nearly\n20,000 fedayeen in Jordan.[27]\n\nIraq and Syria offered training programs for several thousand guerrillas. The\nPersian Gulf states, led by Kuwait, raised money for them through a 5% tax on\nthe salaries of their tens of thousands of resident Palestinian workers, and a\nfund drive in Lebanon raised $500,000 from Beirut alone. The Palestinian\norganizations began to guarantee a lifetime support for the families of all\nguerrillas killed in action.[27] Within a year after the battle, Fatah had\nbranches in about eighty countries.[46]\n\nAfter the battle, Fatah began to engage in communal projects to achieve\npopular affiliation.[47] The battle of Karameh and the subsequent increase in\nthe PLO's strength are considered to have been important catalysts for the\n1970 events of the civil war known as Black September,[48] in which the\nkingdom managed to expel the Palestinian groups to Lebanon after they had\nstarted to gain control over Jordan.[20]\n\nLater, the United Nations Security Council issued resolution 248 which\ncondemned the Israeli raid on Jordanian territory and the violation of the\ncease-fire line, it recalled on resolutions 237 which had encouraged Israel to\nensure the safety of civilians in military areas. The resolution affirmed that\nreprisals were not to be tolerated and that repetitions of such violations\nwould have forced the Security Council to take further steps.[22]\n\nThe battle was the first engagement between the Israelis and Palestinians, in\nwhich the latter used suicide bombers.[21]\n\nIn a 2011 report by Haaretz, files released by the IDF had contradicted the\nofficial Israeli story that claimed that the operation was a retaliatory for\nthe bus incident. The files revealed that the IDF had plans for the two\noperations, prepared in 1967, one year before the bus incident. Files also\nrevealed that the IDF had practiced crossing the Jordan River in 1966 during\nthe Jordanian occupation of the West Bank.[5]\n\n## Historiography[edit]\n\n### Israeli historiography[edit]\n\nIsrael maintains that it had performed a coordinated withdrawal after\nachieving its goal of destroying the Karameh camp. However, few Israeli\nmilitary personnel who participated in Karameh agree.[5] According to Lt. Col.\nArik Regev, chief of Central Command's operations branch,\n\n\u201c | We didn't expect the Jordanian army to fight the way it did. I don't\nbelieve that the commander of the 7th Brigade thought that so many of his\ntanks would be hit. I'm sure that no one thought that the enemy would respond\nwith artillery fire. You're allowed to make a mistake in assessing a situation\nbut, it seems to me, there was a moment when the assessment could have been\naltered \u2013 when we saw that things weren't turning out as we had thought and\nthat the Jordanians weren't fleeing to Amman. Had we thought that the\nJordanian army would act as it did, I'm convinced the air force would have\nstruck first.[5] | \u201d  \n---|---|---  \n  \nMoshe Brblt, a sergeant in the Israeli Armored Corps later talked about his\nparticipation in Karameh \"Everything was burning around me, and whenever I\ntried I could not get up.\"[49]\n\nDr. Asher Porat stated \"lessons of the operation became clear that it was a\nmistake to fight the Jordanian army.\"[50]\n\nMuki Betser, a commander in the Sayeret Matkal unit of the Israel Defense\nForces wrote in his book,\n\n\u201c | Both military and political decision makers responsible for the operation\nworked to make sure the public never knew of the debacle. Instead, in\nnewspaper interviews and speeches, the politicians and generals made Karameh\nsound like a smashing success.[23] | \u201d  \n---|---|---  \n  \n### Jordanian and Palestinian historiography[edit]\n\nArab history of the war mentions that Israel had entered the Battle of Karameh\nwith too much confidence, since it took place just after Israel had defeated\nJordan in the 1967 Six-Day War. The size of the Israeli forces entering\nKarameh made the Jordanians assume that Israel was also planning to occupy the\neastern plateau of the Jordan River basin, namely Balqa Governorate, in order\nto create a Golan Heights similar situation so as to be used a bargaining\nchip. Jordanians claim that Israeli military officials have invited\njournalists on the previous day for lunch in western Jordan after occupying\nit.[19]\n\nThe Battle of Karameh was the subject of many artworks, stamps and\nposters.[51]\n\n## Bibliography[edit]\n\n  * Dupuy, Trevor N.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Albums_Chart", "article": "![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Official_Albums_Chart_\n%28UK%29.jpg/220px-Official_Albums_Chart_%28UK%29.jpg)\n\nThe Official Albums Chart logo, as introduced by the Official Charts Company\nin October 2011\n\nThe **UK Albums Chart** (currently entitled the **Official Albums Chart**) is\na list of albums ranked by physical and digital sales and (from March 2015)\naudio streaming[1] in the United Kingdom. It was published for the first time\non 22 July 1956 and is compiled every week by the Official Charts Company\n(OCC) on Fridays (previously Sundays). It is broadcast on BBC Radio 1 (top 5)\nand published in _Music Week_ magazine (top 75), on the OCC website (top 100)\nand in _UKChartsPlus_ magazine (top 200).\n\nTo qualify for the Official Albums Chart the album must be the correct length\nand price. It must be more than three tracks or 20 minutes long and not be\nclassed as a budget album. A budget album costs between \u00a30.50 and \u00a33.75.\nAdditionally, various artist compilations \u2013 which until January 1989 were\nincluded in the main album listing \u2013 are now listed separately in a\ncompilations chart. Full details of the rules can be found on the OCC\nwebsite.[2]\n\nAccording to the canon of the OCC, the official British albums chart was the\n_Melody Maker_ chart from 8 November 1958 to March 1960 (although the _Record\nMirror_ published charts from 22 July 1956[3]); the _Record Retailer_ chart\nfrom 1960 to 1969; and the Official Albums Chart from 1969 on. In the 1970s\nthe new album chart was revealed at 12:45\u00a0pm on Thursdays on BBC Radio 1, and\nthen moved to 6:05\u00a0pm (later 6:30\u00a0pm) on Wednesday evenings during the Peter\nPowell and Bruno Brookes shows. In October 1987 it moved to Monday lunchtimes,\nduring the Gary Davies show, and from April to October 1993 it briefly had its\nown show from 7:00\u20138:00\u00a0pm on Sunday evenings, introduced by Lynn Parsons.\nSince October 1993 it has been included in _The Official Chart_ show from 4:00\n\u2013 5:45\u00a0pm on Fridays (previously from 4:00 \u2013 7:00\u00a0pm on Sundays). A weekly\n'Album Chart' show was licensed out to BBC Radio 2 and presented by Simon\nMayo, until it ended on 2 April 2007.\n\nThough album sales tend to produce more revenue and, over time, act as a\ngreater measure of an artist's success, this chart receives less media\nattention than the UK Singles Chart, because overall sales of an album are\nmore important than its peak position. 2005 saw a record number of artist\nalbum sales with 126.2\u00a0million sold in the UK.[4] In February 2015, it was\nannounced that, due to the falling sales of albums and rise in popularity of\naudio streaming, the Official Albums Chart would begin including streaming\ndata from March 2015.[1] The final number one album on the UK Albums Chart to\nbe based purely on sales alone was _Smoke + Mirrors_ by Imagine Dragons. On 1\nMarch 2015, _In the Lonely Hour_ by Sam Smith became the first album to top\nthe new streaming-incorporated Official Albums Chart.[5]\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Record holders\n    * 1.1 Debut albums\n  * 2 See also\n  * 3 References\n  * 4 External links\n\n## Record holders[edit]\n\nThe most successful artists in the charts depends on the criteria used. As of\nFebruary 2016, Queen albums have spent more time on the British album charts\nthan any other musical act,[6][7] followed by The Beatles, Elvis Presley, U2\nand ABBA. By most weeks at number one, however, The Beatles lead with a grand\ntotal of 174 weeks, and the most number one albums of all with 15.[8] The male\nsolo artist with the most weeks at number one is Presley with a total of 65\nweeks. Presley also holds the record for the most number one albums by a male\nsolo artist (12) and most top ten albums by any artist (50).[9] Madonna has\nthe most number one albums (12) by a female artist in the UK, though this\nincludes the _Evita_ film soundtrack which was a cast recording and not\nstrictly a Madonna album.[10] Adele is the female solo artist with the most\nweeks at number one, with a total of 34 weeks.[11]\n\nQueen's _Greatest Hits_ is the best-selling album in UK chart history with 6\nmillion copies sold as of February 2014.[12] Previous second-place holder The\nBeatles' _Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band_ has been edged into third-\nplace by ABBA's _Gold: Greatest Hits_. Both albums have sold in excess of 5.1\nmillion copies.[13] The longest running number one album, both consecutively\nand non-consecutively, is the soundtrack of the film _South Pacific_. It had a\nconsecutive run of seventy weeks from November 1958 to March 1960 (meaning it\nwas number one for the entire year of 1959), and had further runs at the top\nin 1960 and 1961, making a non-consecutive total of 115 weeks.\n\nThe youngest artist to top the chart is Neil Reid, whose debut album topped\nthe chart in 1972 when he was only 12 years old.[14]\n\nThe oldest living artist to top the charts is Vera Lynn at the age of 92 with\n_We'll Meet Again: The Very Best of Vera Lynn_, released in 2009 (though the\nalbum only contains material she recorded between 1936 and 1959).\n\nThe album which has spent the most weeks on the charts is Queen's _Greatest\nHits_ with over 700 weeks on its own and a further 211 weeks as part of _The\nPlatinum Collection_. See List of albums which have spent the most weeks on\nthe UK Albums Chart for full details.\n\nIn 1980, Kate Bush became the first British female artist to have a number-one\nalbum in the UK with _Never for Ever_, as well as being the first album by any\nfemale solo artist to _enter_ the chart at number 1. In August 2014 she became\nthe first female artist to have eight albums in the Official UK Top 40 Albums\nChart simultaneously, (altogether she had eleven albums in the Top 50 in one\nweek).[15] She is currently in fourth place for artists having the most\nsimultaneous UK Top 40 albums, behind Elvis Presley and David Bowie who both\ntie for the most simultaneous Top 40 albums (twelve each, both immediately\nfollowing their deaths in 1977 and 2016 respectively),[16] and The Beatles who\nhad eleven in 2009 when remastered versions of their albums were released.\n\nThe fastest selling album (first chart week sales) is _25_ by Adele. Released\nin November 2015, it sold over 800,000 copies in its first week.[17]\n\n_The X Factor'_s 2006 runner up, Ray Quinn, is the only solo artist to top the\nalbum chart without ever releasing a single, though Led Zeppelin achieved\neight consecutive number-one albums from 1970 to 1979 without releasing a\nsingle in the UK until 1997.\n\nThe biggest drop from number one was by Christina Aguilera with her 2010\nalbum, _Bionic_. The album fell from the top spot in its second week to number\n29.[18]\n\nThe Rolling Stones have reached number one in the album chart during five\ndifferent decades (1960s, 70s, 80s, 90s and then in the 2010s with a deluxe\nre-release of their 1972 album _Exile on Main Street_). ABBA have reached the\ntop spot in four _consecutive_ decades, though this was with the same album\n(_Gold_) in the 1990s and the 2000s. For solo artists, Elvis Presley has\nscored UK number-one albums in five different decades (1950s, 60s, 70s, 2000s\nand 2010s). In 1993, Cliff Richard became the first male solo artist to score\nUK number-one albums in four _consecutive_ decades (1960s, 70s, 80s and 90s).\nIn 2010, Kylie Minogue became the first female solo artist to have UK number-\none albums in four consecutive decades (1980s, 90s, 2000s and 2010s).\n\nThe longest number one by a group is Simon and Garfunkel's _Bridge Over\nTroubled Water_ which was no.1 for 33 weeks (13 of which were consecutive).\nThe longest consecutive number one by a group was The Beatles' _Please Please\nMe_, which held the top spot for a straight 30 weeks. The longest number one\nby a male solo artist was Elvis Presley with _G.I. Blues_ which stayed at the\ntop for 22 weeks (his _Blue Hawaii_ album was also the longest consecutive\nnumber one album for a male artist with 17 weeks). Adele's album _21_ has the\nmost weeks at number one by a female solo artist (and by a solo artist of\neither gender) with 23 weeks, 11 of which were consecutive (which is also a\nrecord for a female artist).\n\nRihanna's album _Talk That Talk_ holds the record for having the lowest one-\nweek sales while at the top of the chart, when it was number one the week of\n12 August 2012 on sales of only 9,578 copies.[19]\n\n### Debut albums[edit]\n\nThe fastest selling _debut_ albums (first week sales):\n\n  * All-time highest, and highest by a solo female artist is Susan Boyle with _I Dreamed a Dream_, which sold 411,820 copies in 2009.[20]\n  * By a band is Arctic Monkeys with _Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not_, which sold 363,735 copies in 2006.[21]\n  * By a solo male act is Craig David with _Born to Do It_, which sold 225,320 copies in 2000.[22]\n\nSam Smith holds the record for most weeks spent in the Top 10 by a debut album\nwith _In the Lonely Hour_, with 76, surpassing a record previously held by\nEmeli Sand\u00e9 and The Beatles.[23]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * UK Singles Chart\n  * List of UK Albums Chart Christmas number ones\n  * List of UK Albums Chart number ones\n  * List of artists by number of UK Albums Chart number ones\n  * List of artists who have spent the most weeks on the UK music charts\n  * List of best-selling albums by year in the United Kingdom\n  * List of albums which have spent the most weeks on the UK Albums Chart\n  * List of singles which have spent the most weeks on the UK Singles Chart\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ _**a**_ _**b**_ \"UK's Official Albums Chart to include streaming data for first time\".

It has been argued[2] that concept albums\nshould refer only to albums that bring in themes or story lines from outside\nof music, given that a collection of love songs or songs from within a certain\ngenre are not usually considered to be a \"concept album.\"\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 History\n    * 1.1 1940s\u20131960s\n      * 1.1.1 Early rock concept albums\n    * 1.2 1970\u20131980\n    * 1.3 1980-1990\n    * 1.4 1990-2000\n    * 1.5 2000s\u2013present\n  * 2 See also\n  * 3 References\n\n## History[edit]\n\nSee also: Album era\n\n### 1940s\u20131960s[edit]\n\nWoody Guthrie's _Dust Bowl Ballads_ (1940) is regarded as one of the first\nconcept albums, consisting exclusively of semi-autobiographical songs about\nthe hardships of American migrant labourers during the 1930s.[3] Merle Travis'\n_Folk Songs of the Hills_ (1947) can be considered a concept album as it\nexclusively features songs about working life on railroads and in coal mines.\n\nIn the early 1950s, before the mainstream breakthrough of rock and roll,\nconcept albums were mostly prevalent in jazz music. Singer Frank Sinatra\nrecorded several notable concept albums prior to the 1960s rock era, including\n_In the Wee Small Hours_ (1955; songs about loneliness, heartache,\nintrospection, and nightlife), _Where Are You?_ (1957; songs about heartache),\n_Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely_ (1958; songs about loneliness and\nheartache), _Come Fly with Me_ (1958; songs about world travel), and _No One\nCares_ (1959; songs about loneliness and depression).[4][5][6] Often credited\nas the innovator or originator of the concept album, Frank Sinatra's _The\nVoice of Frank Sinatra_ (1946), _Songs for Young Lovers_ (1954), and _In the\nWee Small Hours_ (1955) are generally considered among the first, if not the\nfirst, concept albums.[7][8][9][10][11][12][13] Singer/pianist Nat King Cole's\nconcept albums include _After Midnight_ (1956; collaborations with jazz\ninstrumentalists in the style of late-night jam sessions) and \"Penthouse\nSerenade\" (1955; songs detailing the \"cocktail piano\" era.).\n\nAfter finding success with stand-alone singles, country icon Johnny Cash\nturned to themed albums, such as _Songs of Our Soil_ (1959; songs about death\nand mortality), _Bitter Tears: Ballads of the American Indian_ (1961) and\n_Blood, Sweat and Tears_ (1963; songs about blue-collar workers).\n\n#### Early rock concept albums[edit]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-\nclear.svg.png)\n\n| This section **focuses too much on specific examples** without clearly\ndiscussing its abstract general subject.

The Beach\nBoys' _Pet Sounds_ portrayed Brian Wilson's state of mind at the time, and was\nin turn a major inspiration to Paul McCartney. Album writers Brian Wilson and\nTony Asher insist that the narrative was not intended, though Wilson has\nstated that the idea of the record being a \"concept album\" is mainly within\nthe way the album was produced and structured.[15] Later in 1966, Wilson began\nwork on _Smile_, an intentional narrative, though it was scrapped and later\nrevived in November 2011. _Freak Out!_, Frank Zappa and The Mothers of\nInvention's sardonic farce about rock music and America as a whole, and _Face\nto Face_ by The Kinks, the first collection of Ray Davies's idiosyncratic\ncharacter studies of ordinary people, are conceptually oriented albums.\nHowever, of the three, only _Pet Sounds_ attracted a large commercial\naudience.\n\n_Save for a Rainy Day_, by Jan &amp; Dean, had a concept featuring all rain-\nthemed songs. In between each song there is a sound of rain. Dean Torrence\nrecorded this album in 1966 as Jan &amp; Dean soon after Jan Berry had his car\ncrash near Dead Man's Curve in California. Torrence posed with Berry's brother\nKen for the album cover photos. Columbia Records released one single from the\nproject (\"Yellow Balloon\") as did the song's writer, Gary Zekley, with The\nYellow Balloon, but with legal wrangles scuttling Torrence's Columbia deal and\nBerry's disapproval of the project, _Save for a Rainy Day_ remained a self-\nreleased album on the J&amp;D Record Co. label (JD-101).[16] Sundazed Records\nreissued _Save for a Rainy Day_ in 1996 in CD and vinyl formats, as well as\nthe collector's vinyl 7\" companion EP, \"Sounds For A Rainy Day,\" featuring\nfour instrumental versions of tracks from the album.\n\nThe Beatles' _Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band_, released in June 1967,\nwould later bring about the notion of the concept album, with the earlier\nprototypes and examples from traditional pop music and other genres sometimes\nforgotten. Original reception described the album as a concept by select\ndefinitions of the term. There was, at some stage during the making of the\nalbum, an attempt to relate the material to firstly the idea of aging, then as\nan obscure radio play about the life of an ex-army bandsman and his\nshortcomings. These concepts were lost in the final production. While debate\nexists over the extent to which _Sgt. Pepper_ qualifies as a true concept\nalbum, there is no doubt that its reputation as such helped inspire other\nartists to produce concept albums of their own, and inspired the public to\nanticipate them. Lennon and McCartney distanced themselves from the \"concept\nalbum\" tag as applied to that album.[17]\n\n_Days of Future Passed_, released the same year as _Sgt. Pepper's Lonely\nHearts Club Band_, was fellow British musicians The Moody Blues' first concept\nalbum. Originally presented with an opportunity to rock out Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's Symphony\nNo. 9 \"From the New World\" by their new stereophonic label, the band instead\nforged ahead to unify their own orchestral-based threads of a day in the life\nof a common man.[18]\n\n_The Who Sell Out_ by The Who followed with its concept of a pirate radio\nbroadcast. Within the record, joke commercials recorded by the band and actual\njingles from recently outlawed pirate radio station Radio London were\ninterspersed between the songs, ranging from pop songs to hard rock and\npsychedelic rock, culminating with a mini-opera titled \"Rael.\"[19]\n\nIn October 1967, British psychedelic rock group Nirvana released their debut\nalbum, _The Story of Simon Simopath_, to moderate commercial success. The\nsongs' lyrics depict the life and death of the titular hero, blending various\nmythological themes, such as the existence of centaurs and goddesses, with\nthose of science fiction.\n\n_S.F. Sorrow_ by British group the Pretty Things, released in December 1968,\nis generally considered to be among the first creatively successful rock\nconcept albums, in that each song is part of an overarching unified concept \u2013\nthe life story of the main character, Sebastian Sorrow.[20]\n\nThe album _Head_ by The Monkees, released in 1968, and the soundtrack to the\nmovie of the same name, was their only concept album. It contains psychedelic\nsongs that ventured away from their usual pop rock offerings such as \"Porpoise\nSong\". It also contains \"Do I Have To Do This All Over Again\" and \"Can You Dig\nIt\", which are very different from their usual songs.\n\n_The Turtles Present the Battle of the Bands_ was a facetious effort from The\nTurtles, who were at war with their record label White Whale Records. The\nalbum, released in November 1968, portrayed a battle of the bands between\nvarious widely varying fictional bands (all portrayed by the Turtles). It\nspawned two hits: \"You Showed Me,\" written by members of The Byrds; and\n\"Elenore,\" a spoof of their earlier hits and sarcastic response to White Whale\n(who had constantly pressured the band for more sunshine pop hits in the vein\nof their earlier work) that thanks to slick production became a hit in its own\nright.\n\nThe rock opera _Tommy_, released in April 1969, was composed by Pete Townshend\nand performed by The Who. This acclaimed work was presented over two LPs and\nit took the idea of thematically based albums to a much higher appreciation by\nboth critics and the public. It was also the first story-based concept album\nof the rock era (as distinct from the _song-cycle_ style album) to enjoy\ncommercial success. The Who went on to further explorations of the concept\nalbum format with their follow-up project _Lifehouse_, which was abandoned\nbefore completion, and with their 1973 rock opera, _Quadrophenia_.[21]\n\nFive months after the release of _Tommy_, The Kinks released another concept\nalbum, _Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)_ (September\n1969), written by Ray Davies; though considered by some a rock opera, it was\noriginally conceived as the score for a proposed but never realised BBC\ntelevision drama. It was the first of several concept albums released by the\nband through the first few years of the 1970s.

From Greece, Aphrodite's Child, helmed by keyboardist Vangelis,\nreleased _666_ in 1972. The double album, based on various passages from The\nBible, was controversial for its title and sleeve notes. Italy's Banco del\nMutuo Soccorso released _Darwin!_ in 1972, a success that lead to the band to\nsigning with Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer's Manticore Records. Triumvirat, a\nGerman progressive rock band signed with EMI to produce several concept albums\nincluding _Mediterranean Tales_, _Pompeii_ and in 1975, what is considered by\nmany[_who?_] to be a masterpiece of the genre, _Spartacus_.The Americas also\nproduced their share of concept albums during this period.[_citation needed_]\nFrom 1975 to 1979, Canadian progressive power trio Rush released three albums\ncontaining sidelong epics, regarded by some as concept albums (though not\nactually concept albums by strict definition of the term; that is, none of the\nother songs on the album have anything to do with each other or the 20-minute\nsidelong epic, so there is no pervasive concept or story). The first of these\nwas released in 1975, titled _Caress of Steel_. The second was their\nbreakthrough album, _2112_, released the following year in 1976. Their third\nwas released in 1978, _Hemispheres_.Concept albums were hardly the exclusive\nproduct of progressive rock bands in the 1970s. From Country to Glam, artists\nfrom all genres would embrace the popularity of the LP to explore broader\nconcepts that the 45 would have made impossible.[_citation needed_]\n\nMichael Nesmith blossomed creatively after quitting The Monkees, as an\noriginator of what would become Country rock and in 1974 released the\nelaborately packaged concept album _The Prison: A Book with a\nSoundtrack_.[_citation needed_] Willie Nelson is a pioneer of concept albums\nwithin country music.[24] In 1974 he released _Phases and Stages_ describing a\ndivorce from the viewpoint of the woman on Side One and the man on Side Two.\nHis 1975 album, _Red Headed Stranger_, about the fatal estrangement of a\ncowboy from his unfaithful wife, followed and would reach #1 on the American\ncountry charts.Dolly Parton's 1973 concept album _My Tennessee Mountain Home_\ntold the story of her rural Appalachian childhood, culminating in the song\n\"Down on Music Row\", which detailed her departure at age 18 for Nashville to\nembark on her career; her 1981 album _9 to 5 and Odd Jobs_ (built around her\nhit song \"Nine to Five\"), was a concept album that focused on work and\nemployment.\n\n### 1980-1990[edit]\n\nGenesis reinvented themselves as a sleek trio with the release of 1980's\n_Duke_. This tale of fame, wealth, success and lost love was arguably the\nband's first full LP concept since 1974's _The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway_. It\nwas a huge commercial success, becoming their first UK number one album, and\nbegan a new, pop-oriented era for the band. \"Turn It On Again\" became the\nband's second UK top ten single.[25] Whether _Duke_ qualifies as a concept\nalbum is a matter of some confusion. It has been described as \"in part a\nconcept album, in part not\".[26] It has been said that \"there does not seem to\nbe a 'bigger picture' behind the songs, and it is uncertain whether there ever\nwas an underlying concept\".[27] Inspired by _The Wall_, glam rock band Kiss\nrecruited Lou Reed for lyrical assistance and released _Music from \"The\nElder\"_ in 1981. Due to the album's radical departure in musical style\ncompared to Kiss's previous offerings, _Music from \"The Elder\"_ became the\ngroup's poorest selling and charting album in their history. It has, however,\ngrown in cult status since its release.[_citation needed_]\n\nAlthough the progressive rock genre had begun to decline in popularity by the\nlate 1970s, concept albums were still proving successful for well-established\nprogressive rock bands, and a new subgenre, neo-progressive rock, emerged in\nthe 1980s.[28] In 1985, the British neo-progressive rock band Marillion\nachieved their only UK number one album \u2013 and the best-selling album of their\ncareer \u2013 with _Misplaced Childhood_, a concept album featuring lyrics by\nfrontman Fish which were partly autobiographical. The album was played as two\ncontinuous pieces of music on the two sides of the vinyl and produced the\nband's two biggest hit singles, \"Kayleigh\" and \"Lavender\".[29] The band's\nfollow-up in 1987, _Clutching at Straws_, has also been described as a concept\nalbum.[30]\n\nIn 1988, British heavy metal band Iron Maiden released their only concept\nalbum to date, _Seventh Son of a Seventh Son_, which focused on concepts of\nprophecies, premonitions, good vs. evil and follows a vague story line of a\nboy who possess special powers due to his bloodline. The album has been highly\npraised critically and it debuted at No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart. This\nprogressive metal style proved extremely influential and would later be copied\nby many other progressive metal bands.\n\nStyx continued to have multiplatinum albums with their 1981 release _Paradise\nTheater_ (a concept album about a decaying theater in Chicago which became a\nmetaphor for childhood and American culture) and 1983's _Kilroy Was Here_ (a\nscience fiction rock opera about a future where moralists imprison\nrockers).[31] The elaborate concept would produce two top ten hits in the U.S.\nwith \"Mr. Roboto\" and \"Don't Let It End\", but arguments over the direction of\nthe band toward increasingly dramatic concept productions led to a breakup in\n1984.\n\n### 1990-2000[edit]\n\nIn the 1990s neo-progressive rock had all but faded from popular music, but\nsome bands, such as Marillion, still had a sizeable cult fanbase. Their 1994\nconcept album, _Brave_, was described as \"the most complex Marillion release\nto date\",[32] and became the final Marillion album to reach the UK top\nten.[25] With the advent of alternative rock, however, a number of artists\nstill continued to use the format within that genre. Other concept albums to\nthen emerge not only from rock, but also from hiphop were to soon follow,\nespecially in the mafioso themed, New York City-stylized music of acs\nincluding Mobb Deep, Capone-N-Noreaga, and other Wu-tang works.[_citation\nneeded_]\n\n### 2000s\u2013present[edit]\n\nColdplay's fifth album _Mylo Xyloto_, released in 2011, is a concept album.\nThe theme of this album is the freedom of expressing yourself and not letting\nothers suppress who you are. This concept is followed up in the band's comic\nseries of the same name, Mylo Xyloto (comics).\n\nArcade Fire's 2010 concept album _The Suburbs_ debuted at #1 and won Album of\nthe Year at the 2011 Grammy Awards. Its themes focus on regret and lost youth.\n\nBlack Veil Brides album Wretched and Divine: The Story of the Wild Ones is a\nconcept album made in 2012 with some of the songs in a film called Legion of\nthe Black.\n\nAll of Coheed and Cambria's studio albums (with the exception of their 2015\nrelease _The Color Before the Sun_) are concept albums, but in their case the\nidea is taken a step further: their entire discography is putatively one grand\nconceptual interpretation of an epic story authored by lead singer Claudio\nSanchez in graphic novels titled _The Amory Wars_.\n\nSamsas Traum's 2004 album a.Ura und das Schnecken.Haus tells a surrealist\ncoming-of-age love story. The album is also a loose autobiography of frontman\nAlexander Kaschte.\n\nUntoten has a few concept albums. Two of the most well-known are about\ninfamous historical events with paranormal undertones. Die Blutgr\u00e4fin, which\ntells the story of Hungarian vampire countess Elizabeth Bathory, and Die\nNonnen von Loudun, about the Loudun possessions.\n\nCelldweller made two conceptual albums. Wish Upon a Blackstar was originally\nnot intended to be a concept album, but as more tracks were written, the\nconcept grew. It was later turned into a novel, under the title, Blackstar.\nEnd of an Empire was intentionally written with the idea of a concept in mind.\nThe concept was later made into a 40-page comic called, \"The Traveller.\"\n\nASP's 2008 album Zaubererbruder \u2013 Der Krabat-Liederzyklus is about the Wendish\nlegend of Krabat. A poor beggar who starts working for a miller, later\nlearning that this miller practices Black magic. He becomes an apprentice to\nthe miller, and eventually a powerful magician himself. Eventually, he sees\nhow evil the miller is, and realizes he needs to escape.\n\nThe Smashing Pumpkins' album, Machina/The Machines of God, was released in\n2000 and is considered a loose-concept album. The album's concept is loosely\nabout 'a rock star gone mad'. Its sequel album, Machina II/The Friends and\nEnemies of Modern Music, is also considered a concept album, focusing on the\nthemes of its predecessor. _Machina II_ was released the same year as\n_Machina/The Machines of God_, with only 25 copies being made. Those 25 copies\nwere either given to friends of the band or prominent fans of the band in the\nonline community, with instruction to distribute the album for free. _Machina_\nreceived generally favourable reviews, though fared poorly in commercial\nperformance. Due to _Machina II's_ unusual release_,_ very few professional\nreviews were published, the reviews that had surfaced however were unanimously\npositive.\n\nJay-Z's tenth studio album _American Gangster_, released November 6, 2007, is\ninspired by the movie American Gangster, and is considered to be a concept\nalbum.

The album was released on January seventh, in 2005.\n\nBlaze Bayley's album Tenth Dimension, released in 2002, is a concept album.\nBlaze's band was then known as Blaze. Bayley is currently working on another\nconcept album, set to be released in 2016, under the working title \"Album 8\".\n\nDeath Cab for Cutie's album We Have the Facts and We're Voting Yes, is a\nconcept album. It was the bands second studio album and was released in 2000.\nThe concept was set around a ruined relationship. Their fourth studio album,\nTransatlanticism, was released in 2003 and received critical acclaim.

It also won a Grammy in\n2005 for Best Rock Album and was nominated for Album of the Year.\n\nLinkin Park's 4th studio album _A Thousand Suns_, released in 2010 is widely\nregarded as a partial concept album.

The album spent 30 weeks on the _Billboard 200_ and\nsold 2,600,000 copies worldwide as of June 2014.\n\nMarina And The Diamonds album, Electra Heart, is a concept album about the\nembodiment of \"female identity\", with the main character Electra Heart\nportraying herself in the form of several female archetypes, known as the\n\"Idle Teen\", \"Homewrecker\", \"Beauty Queen\", and \"Housewife\".

The\nalbum is centered around a supposed transmission of human origin that was\nbroadcast from the constellation Ophiuchus, which foretells the future and\ndemise of mankind. Led by frontman Dustin Bates (frontman for Downplay),\nStarset set up an elaborate online presence\u2014complete with scientific videos,\ndocuments, links to shadowy agencies, etc. \u2013 that led up to the album's\neventual release in 2014. The first two singles, \"Carnivore\" and \"My Demons,\"\nappeared in 2013, introducing the band's dramatic style, which includes\nelectronic elements, strings, heavy alt-rock, and mysterious sample recordings\nsurrounding the theme of the album.\n\nTaylor Swift's 2010 album _Speak Now_ is considered a concept album revolving\nmainly about things that were unspoken in the past and the power to tell the\ntruth.

The film centers around a confined rocker named\nFloyd \"Pink\" Pinkerton, who after being driven into insanity by the death of\nhis father and many depressive moments, constructs a metaphorical (and\nsometimes physical) wall to be protected from the world and emotional\nsituations around him; when this coping mechanism backfires he demands himself\nfree.

However, the film is mostly\ndriven by music, and does not feature much dialogue. Gerald Scarfe drew and\nanimated 15 minutes of animated sequences, which appear at several points in\nthe film. It was the seventh animated feature to be presented in Dolby Stereo.\nThe film is best known for its disturbing surreal environment, animated\nsequences, violence and gore, sexual situations, characterization, and many\nmore that caused it to be one of the most surreal musicals of all time. The\nfilm has since fared well generally, and has established cult status.\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Plot\n  * 2 Cast\n  * 3 Production\n    * 3.1 Concept\n    * 3.2 Development\n    * 3.3 Filming\n  * 4 Connections\n  * 5 Release\n    * 5.1 Box office and critical reception\n    * 5.2 Home media\n    * 5.3 Awards\n  * 6 Documentary\n  * 7 Soundtrack\n  * 8 References\n  * 9 External links\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\nPink, the protagonist, is a rock star, one of several reasons behind his\napparent depressive and detached emotional state. He is first seen in an\nunkempt hotel room, motionless and expressionless, watching television. The\nopening music is the Vera Lynn recording of \"The Little Boy that Santa Claus\nForgot\". It is revealed that Pink's father, a British soldier, was killed in\naction while defending the Anzio bridgehead during World War II, in Pink's\ninfancy.\n\nIn a flashback, Pink is a young English boy growing up in the early 1950s.\nThroughout his childhood, Pink longs for a father figure. He discovers a\nscroll from \"kind old King George\" and other relics from his father's military\nservice and death. At school, he is humiliated for writing poems in class (the\npoem being Pink Floyd's \"Money\"). After the teacher reads the poem out loud,\n\"Another Brick in the Wall Part 2\" is played, and children are shown in a\nsurrealistically oppressive school system, falling into a meat grinder. The\nchildren then rise in rebellion and destroy the school, carrying the Teacher\naway to an unknown fate. Pink is also negatively affected by his\noverprotective mother. Such traumatic experiences are represented as \"bricks\"\nin the metaphorical wall he constructs around himself that divides him from\nsociety.\n\nAs an adult, Pink eventually marries, but he and his wife soon grow apart.\nWhile he is in the United States on tour, Pink learns that his wife is having\nan affair. He turns to a willing groupie, who he brings back to his hotel room\nonly to trash it in a fit of violence, terrifying the groupie out of the\napartment.\n\nPink slowly begins to lose his mind to metaphorical \"worms\". He shaves all his\nbody hair and, while watching _The Dam Busters_ on television, morphs into a\nneo-Nazi alter-ego. Pink's manager, along with the hotel manager and some\nparamedics, discover Pink unresponsive and inject him with drugs to enable him\nto perform.\n\nPink fantasises that he is a dictator and his concert is a neo-Nazi rally. His\nfollowers proceed to attack ethnic minorities, and Pink holds a rally in\nsuburban London, singing \"Waiting for the Worms\". The scene is intercut with\nimages of animated marching hammers that goose-step across ruins. Pink screams\n\"Stop!\" and takes refuge in the toilets at the concert venue, reciting poems.\n\nIn a climactic animated sequence, Pink, depicted as a small, almost inanimate\nrag doll, is on trial, and his sentence is \"to be exposed before [his] peers.\"\nThe judge gives the order to \"tear down the wall\". Following a prolonged\nsilence, the wall is smashed.\n\nSeveral children are seen cleaning up a pile of debris after an earlier riot,\nwith a freeze-frame on one of the children emptying a Molotov cocktail.\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n  * Bob Geldof as Floyd \"Pink\" Pinkerton \n    * Kevin McKeon as young Pink\n    * David Bingham as little Pink\n  * Christine Hargreaves as Pink's mother\n  * Eleanor David as Pink's wife\n  * Alex McAvoy as Teacher\n  * Bob Hoskins as Rock-and-roll manager\n  * Michael Ensign as Hotel manager\n  * James Laurenson as J.A.

When a band or a person becomes an idol,\nit can have to do with the success that that person manifests, not the quality\nof work he produces. You don't become a fanatic because somebody's work is\ngood, you become a fanatic to be touched vicariously by their glamour and\nfame. Stars\u2014film stars, rock 'n' roll stars\u2014represent, in myth anyway, the\nlife as we'd all like to live it. They seem at the very centre of life. And\nthat's why audiences still spend large sums of money at concerts where they\nare a long, long way from the stage, where they are often very uncomfortable,\nand where the sound is often very bad.[4]\n\nWaters was also dismayed by the \"executive approach\", which was only about\nsuccess, not even attempting to get acquainted with the actual persons of whom\nthe band was comprised (addressed in an earlier song from _Wish You Were\nHere_, \"Have a Cigar\"). The concept of the wall, along with the decision to\nname the lead character \"Pink\", partly grew out of that approach, combined\nwith the issue of the growing alienation between the band and their fans.[5]\nThis symbolised a new era for rock bands, as Pink Floyd \"explored (...\u00a0) the\nhard realities of 'being where we are'\", drawing upon existentialists, namely\nJean-Paul Sartre.[6]\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/03/Pinkfloydhammers.jpg/170px-\nPinkfloydhammers.jpg)\n\nThe iconic \"marching hammers\"\n\nEven before the original Pink Floyd album was recorded, a film was intended to\nbe made from it.[7] However, the concept of the film was intended to be live\nfootage from the album's tour, with Scarfe's animation and extra scenes.[8]\nThe film was going to star Waters himself.[8] EMI did not intend to make the\nfilm, as they did not understand the concept.[9]\n\nDirector Alan Parker, a Pink Floyd fan, asked EMI whether _The Wall_ could be\nadapted to film. EMI suggested that Parker talk to Waters, who had asked\nParker to direct the film. Parker instead suggested that he produce it and\ngive the directing task to Gerald Scarfe and Michael Seresin, a\ncinematographer.[10] Waters began work on the film's screenplay after studying\nscriptwriting books. He and Scarfe produced a special-edition book containing\nthe screenplay and art to pitch the project to investors. While the book\ndepicted Waters in the role of Pink, after screen tests, he was removed from\nthe starring role[11] and replaced with punk musician and frontman of the\nBoomtown Rats, Bob Geldof.[8] In _Behind the Wall_, both Waters and Geldof\nlater admitted to a story during casting where Geldof and his manager took a\ntaxi to an airport, and Geldof's manager pitched the role to the singer, who\ncontinued to reject the offer and express his contempt for the project\nthroughout the fare, unaware that the taxi driver was Waters' brother, who\npromptly proceeded to tell Waters about Geldof's opinion.\n\nSince Waters was no longer in the starring role, it no longer made sense for\nthe feature to include Pink Floyd footage, so the live film aspect was\ndropped.[12] The footage culled from the five _Wall_ concerts at Earl's Court\nfrom 13\u201317 June 1981 that were held specifically for filming was deemed\nunusable also for technical reasons as the fast Panavision lenses needed for\nthe low light levels turned out to have insufficient resolution for the movie\nscreen. Complex parts such as \"Hey You\" still had not been properly shot by\nthe end of the live shows.[13] Parker also managed to convince Waters and\nScarfe that the concert footage was too theatrical and that it would jar with\nthe animation and stage live action. After the concert footage was dropped,\nSeresin left the project and Parker became the only director connected to _The\nWall_.[14]\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\nDuring production, while filming the destruction of a hotel room, Geldof\nsuffered a cut to his hand as he pulled away the Venetian blinds. The footage\nremains in the film. Also, it was discovered while filming the pool scenes\nthat Geldof did not know how to swim. Interiors were shot at Pinewood Studios,\nand it was suggested that they suspend Geldof in Christopher Reeve's clear\ncast used for the _Superman_ flying sequences, but his frame was too small by\ncomparison; it was then decided to make a smaller rig that was a more\nacceptable fit, and he simply lay on his back.[15]\n\nThe war scenes were shot on Saunton Sands in North Devon, which was also\nfeatured on the cover of Pink Floyd's _A Momentary Lapse of Reason_ six years\nlater.[16]\n\n## Connections[edit]\n\nIt has been said that, the protagonist in this movie reflects Waters'\nbiography partially. The similarities between two can be listed as:\n\n  * Both of them lost their father in infancy[17]\n  * Both of them faced problems with their wives, and Waters was divorced for several times during his lifetime[17]\n  * Both of them are Rock musicians.\n  * The nuclear war theme in the Wall may be a reflection of nuclear threat in the Cold War.[18]\n  * Pink Floyd, as a band is known with its psychedelic character.[19] Therefore, the psychedelic graphics in the movie may be related to that.\n  * According to Romelo and Cabo, the Nazism and imperialism related symbols may have been a criticism against Margaret Thatcher and the British foreign policy in general especially about the Falklands issue.[18]\n\n## Release[edit]\n\nThe film was shown \"out of competition\" during the 1982 Cannes Film\nFestival.[20]\n\nThe premiere at Cannes was amazing \u2013 the midnight screening. They took down\ntwo truckloads of audio equipment from the recording studios so it would sound\nbetter than normal. It was one of the last films to be shown in the old Palais\nwhich was pretty run down and the sound was so loud it peeled the paint off\nthe walls. It was like snow \u2013 it all started to shower down and everyone had\ndandruff at the end. I remember seeing Terry Semel there, who at the time was\nhead of Warner Brothers, sitting next to Steven Spielberg. They were only five\nrows ahead of me and I'm sure I saw Steven Spielberg mouthing to him at the\nend when the lights came up, 'what the fuck was that?' And Semel turned to me\nand then bowed respectfully.\n\n'What the fuck was that?,' indeed. It was like nothing anyone had ever seen\nbefore \u2013 a weird fusion of live-action, story-telling and of the surreal.\n\nAlan Parker[21]\n\nThe film's official premiere was at the Empire, Leicester Square[22] in\nLondon, on 14 July 1982. It was attended by Waters and fellow Pink Floyd\nmembers David Gilmour and Nick Mason, but not Richard Wright,[22] who was no\nlonger a member of the band. It was also attended by various celebrities\nincluding Geldof, Scarfe, Paula Yates, Pete Townshend, Sting, Roger Taylor,\nJames Hunt, Lulu and Andy Summers.[23]\n\n### Box office and critical reception[edit]\n\nSo it's difficult, painful and despairing, and its three most important\nartists came away from it with bad feelings. Why would anybody want to see it?\nPerhaps because filming this material could not possibly have been a happy\nexperience for anyone\u2014not if it's taken seriously.\n\nRoger Ebert[24]\n\nThe film opened with a limited release on 6 August 1982 and entered at No. 28\nof the US box office charts despite only playing in one theatre on its first\nweekend, grossing over $68,000, a rare feat even by today's standards. The\nfilm then spent just over a month below the top 20 while still in the top 30.\nThe film later expanded to over 600 theatres on 10 September, achieving No. 3\nat the box office charts, below _E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial_, and _An Officer\nand a Gentleman_. The film eventually earned $22 million before closing in\nearly 1983.[3] It earned its creators two British Academy Awards; 'Best Sound'\nfor James Guthrie, Eddy Joseph, Clive Winter, Graham Hartstone &amp; Nicholas\nLe Messurier;[25] and 'Best Original Song' for Waters.[25] The film received\ngenerally positive reviews. Reviewing _The Wall_ on their television programme\n_At the Movies_ in 1982, film critics Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel gave the\nfilm \"two thumbs up\". Ebert described _The Wall_ as \"a stunning vision of\nself-destruction\" and \"one of the most horrifying musicals of all time\u00a0... but\nthe movie is effective. The music is strong and true, the images are like\nsledge hammers, and for once, the rock and roll hero isn't just a spoiled\nnarcissist, but a real, suffering image of all the despair of this nuclear\nage. This is a real good movie.\" Siskel was more reserved in his judgement,\nstating that he felt that the film's imagery was too repetitive. However, he\nadmitted that the \"central image\" of the fascist rally sequence \"will stay\nwith me for an awful long time.\" In February 2010, Roger Ebert added _The\nWall_ to his list of \"great movies,\" describing the film as \"without question\nthe best of all serious fiction films devoted to rock. Seeing it now in more\ntimid times, it looks more daring than it did in 1982, when I saw it at Cannes\n... It's disquieting and depressing and very good.\"[24] It was chosen for\nopening night of Ebertfest 2010\\. While Rotten Tomatoes ranked the film with a\ncritics review of 72% rating (of 17 reviews), the community of the website\nranked the film with an 88% (out of 375 reviews). Danny Peary wrote that the\n\"picture is unrelentingly downbeat and at times repulsive\u00a0... but I don't find\nit unwatchable \u2013 which is more than I could say if Ken Russell had directed\nthis. The cinematography by Peter Bizou is extremely impressive and a few of\nthe individual scenes have undeniable power.\"[26] Waters has expressed deep\nreservations about the film, saying that the filming had been \"a very\nunnerving and unpleasant experience\u00a0... we all fell out in a big way.\" As for\nthe film itself, he said: \"I found it was so unremitting in its onslaught upon\nthe senses, that it didn't give me, anyway, as an audience, a chance to get\ninvolved with it,\" although he had nothing but praise for Geldof's\nperformance.[27] Parker, who frequently clashed with Waters and Gerald Scarfe,\ndescribed the filming as \"one of the most miserable experiences of my creative\nlife.\"[28] David Gilmour stated (on the \"In the Studio with Redbeard\" episodes\nof _The Wall_, _A Momentary Lapse of Reason_ and _On an Island_) that the\nconflict between him and Waters started with the making of the film. Gilmour\nalso stated on the documentary _Behind The Wall_ (which was aired on the BBC\nin the UK and VH1 in the US) that \"the movie was the less successful telling\nof _The Wall_ story as opposed to the album and concert versions.\" Although\nthe symbol of the crossed hammers was a creation of the film and not related\nto any real racist group, it was adopted by white supremacist group the\nHammerskins in the late 1980s.[29]\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n_Pink Floyd \u2013 The Wall_ was released on DVD and VHS on December 2, 1999 by\nMGM/UA Home Entertainment and Columbia Music Video.\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\nList of Awards  \n---  \nAward | Category | Recipient(s) | Result  \nBAFTA Film Award | Best Original Song | Roger Waters For the song \"Another\nBrick in the Wall\" | Won  \nBAFTA Film Award | Best Sound | James Guthrie  \nEddy Joseph  \nClive Winter  \nGraham V.

They consist\nof the ground forces, air force, and navy. It is the sole military wing of the\nIsraeli security forces, and has no civilian jurisdiction within Israel. The\nIDF is headed by its Chief of General Staff, the _Ramatkal_, subordinate to\nthe Defense Minister of Israel; Lieutenant general (_Rav Aluf_) Gadi Eizenkot\nhas served as Chief of Staff since 2015.\n\nAn order from Defense Minister David Ben-Gurion on 26 May 1948 officially set\nup the Israel Defense Forces as a conscript army formed out of the\nparamilitary group Haganah, incorporating the militant groups Irgun and Lehi.\nThe IDF served as Israel's armed forces in all the country's major military\noperations\u2014including the 1948 War of Independence, 1951\u20131956 Retribution\noperations, 1956 Sinai War, 1964\u20131967 War over Water, 1967 Six-Day War,\n1967\u20131970 War of Attrition, 1968 Battle of Karameh, 1973 Operation Spring of\nYouth, 1973 Yom Kippur War, 1976 Operation Entebbe, 1978 Operation Litani,\n1982 Lebanon War, 1982\u20132000 South Lebanon conflict, 1987\u20131993 First Intifada,\n2000\u20132005 Second Intifada, 2002 Operation Defensive Shield, 2006 Lebanon War,\n2008\u20132009 Operation Cast Lead, 2012 Operation Pillar of Defense, and 2014\nOperation Protective Edge. The number of wars and border conflicts in which\nthe IDF has been involved in its short history makes it one of the most\nbattle-trained armed forces in the world.[8][9] While originally the IDF\noperated on three fronts\u2014against Lebanon and Syria in the north, Jordan and\nIraq in the east, and Egypt in the south\u2014after the 1979 Egyptian\u2013Israeli Peace\nTreaty, it has concentrated its activities in southern Lebanon and the\nPalestinian Territories, including the First and the Second Intifada.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces differs from most armed forces in the world in many\nways. Differences include the mandatory conscription of women and its\nstructure, which emphasizes close relations between the army, navy, and air\nforce. Since its founding, the IDF has been specifically designed to match\nIsrael's unique security situation. The IDF is one of Israeli society's most\nprominent institutions, influencing the country's economy, culture and\npolitical scene. In 1965, the Israel Defense Forces was awarded the Israel\nPrize for its contribution to education.[10] The IDF uses several technologies\ndeveloped in Israel, many of them made specifically to match the IDF's needs,\nsuch as the Merkava main battle tank, Achzarit armoured personnel carrier,\nhigh tech weapons systems, the Iron Dome missile defense system, Trophy active\nprotection system for vehicles, and the Galil and Tavor assault rifles. The\nUzi submachine gun was invented in Israel and used by the IDF until December\n2003, ending a service that began in 1954. Following 1967, the IDF has close\nmilitary relations with the United States,[11] including development\ncooperation, such as on the F-15I jet, THEL laser defense system, and the\nArrow missile defense system.\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 History\n  * 2 Etymology\n  * 3 Organization\n    * 3.1 Units\n    * 3.2 Structure\n      * 3.2.1 Regional commands\n      * 3.2.2 Arms\n      * 3.2.3 Other bodies\n      * 3.2.4 Branches and Troops\n    * 3.3 Related bodies\n      * 3.3.1 Security forces\n      * 3.3.2 Development\n    * 3.4 Ranks, uniforms and insignia\n      * 3.4.1 Ranks\n      * 3.4.2 Uniforms\n      * 3.4.3 Insignia\n  * 4 Service\n    * 4.1 Military service routes\n    * 4.2 Special service routes\n      * 4.2.1 Regular service\n      * 4.2.2 Permanent service\n      * 4.2.3 Reserve service\n    * 4.3 Non-IDF service\n    * 4.4 Women\n  * 5 Minorities in the IDF\n    * 5.1 Druze and Circassians\n    * 5.2 Bedouins and Israeli Arabs\n    * 5.3 Ethiopian Jews\n    * 5.4 Haredim\n    * 5.5 LGBT people\n    * 5.6 Deaf and hard-of-hearing people\n    * 5.7 Vegans\n    * 5.8 Volunteers\n  * 6 Overseas volunteers\n  * 7 Doctrine\n    * 7.1 Mission\n    * 7.2 Main doctrine\n      * 7.2.1 Basic points\n      * 7.2.2 Prepare for defense\n      * 7.2.3 Move to counterattack\n    * 7.3 Code of conduct\n      * 7.3.1 Stated values of the IDF\n      * 7.3.2 Military ethics of fighting terror\n  * 8 Command and Control\n  * 9 Budget\n  * 10 Weapons and equipment\n    * 10.1 Military technology\n    * 10.2 Main developments\n  * 11 Commemoration\n    * 11.1 Commemoration\n    * 11.2 Parades\n  * 12 Foreign military relations\n    * 12.1 France\n    * 12.2 United States\n    * 12.3 India\n    * 12.4 Germany\n    * 12.5 United Kingdom\n    * 12.6 China\n    * 12.7 Cyprus\n    * 12.8 Greece\n    * 12.9 Turkey\n    * 12.10 Azerbaijan\n    * 12.11 Other countries\n  * 13 Future\n  * 14 See also\n  * 15 References and footnotes\n  * 16 Further reading\n  * 17 External links\n\n## History[edit]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-\nQuestion_book-new.svg.png)\n\n| This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Ariel Sharon (left), during the Battle of Abu-Ageila, June 1967\n\nMain articles: History of the Israel Defense Forces, Wars involving Israel and\nMilitary operations conducted by the Israel Defense Forces\n\nFurther information: Jewish military history\n\nThe IDF traces its roots to Jewish paramilitary organizations in the New\nYishuv, starting with the Second Aliyah (1904 to 1914).[12] The first such\norganization was Bar-Giora, founded in September 1907. It was converted to\nHashomer in April 1909, which operated until the British Mandate of Palestine\ncame into being in 1920. Hashomer was an elitist organization with narrow\nscope, and was mainly created to protect against criminal gangs seeking to\nsteal property. During World War I, the forerunners of the Haganah/IDF were\nthe Zion Mule Corps and the Jewish Legion, both of which were part of the\nBritish Army. After the Arab riots against Jews in April 1920, the Yishuv's\nleadership saw the need to create a nationwide underground defense\norganization, and the Haganah was founded in June of the same year. The\nHaganah became a full-scale defense force after the 1936\u20131939 Arab revolt in\nPalestine with an organized structure, consisting of three main units\u2014the\nField Corps, Guard Corps, and the Palmach. During World War II the successor\nto the Jewish Legion of World War I was the Jewish Brigade.\n\nThe IDF was founded following the establishment of the State of Israel, after\nDefense Minister and Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion issued an order on 26 May\n1948. The order called for the establishment of the Israel Defense Forces, and\nthe abolishment of all other Jewish armed forces. Although Ben-Gurion had no\nlegal authority to issue such an order, the order was made legal by the\ncabinet on 31 May.[13]\n\nThe two other Jewish underground organizations, Irgun and Lehi, agreed to join\nthe IDF if they would be able to form independent units and agreed not to make\nindependent arms purchases. This was the background for the dispute which led\nto the Altalena Affair, following a confrontation regarding the weapons\npurchased by the Irgun. This resulted in a battle between Irgun members and\nthe newly created IDF. It ended when the ship carrying the arms was shelled.\nFollowing the affair, all independent Irgun and Lehi units were either\ndisbanded or merged into the IDF. The Palmach, a strong lobby within the\nHaganah, also joined the IDF with provisions, and Ben Gurion responded by\ndisbanding its staff in 1949, after which many senior Palmach officers\nretired, notably its first commander, Yitzhak Sadeh.\n\nThe new army organized itself during the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War when\nneighbouring Arab states attacked Israel. Twelve infantry and armored brigades\nformed: Golani, Carmeli, Alexandroni, Kiryati, Givati, Etzioni, the 7th, and\n8th armored brigades, Oded, Harel, Yiftach, and Negev.[14] After the war, some\nof the brigades were converted to reserve units, and others were disbanded.\nDirectorates and corps were created from corps and services in the Haganah,\nand this basic structure in the IDF still exists today.\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/1973_sinai_war_maps2.j\npg/330px-1973_sinai_war_maps2.jpg)\n\n_Operation Gazelle_, Israel's ground maneuver, encircles the Egyptian Third\nArmy, October 1973\n\nImmediately after the 1948 war, the Israel Defense Forces shifted to low\nintensity conflict against Arab Palestinian guerrillas. In the 1956 Suez\nCrisis, the IDF's first test of strength after 1949, the new army proved\nitself by capturing the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt, which was later returned.\nIn the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel conquered the Sinai Peninsula, Gaza Strip,\nWest Bank (including East Jerusalem) and Golan Heights from the surrounding\nArab states, changing the balance of power in the region as well as the role\nof the IDF. In the following years leading up to the Yom Kippur War, the IDF\nfought a war of attrition against Egypt in the Sinai and a border war against\nthe PLO in Jordan, culminating in the Battle of Karameh.\n\nThe surprise of the Yom Kippur War and its aftermath completely changed the\nIDF's procedures and approach to warfare. Organizational changes were made[_by\nwhom?_] and more time was dedicated to training for conventional warfare.\nHowever, in the following years the army's role slowly shifted again to low-\nintensity conflict, urban warfare and counter-terrorism. An example of the\nlatter was the successful 1976 Operation Entebbe commando raid to free\nhijacked airline passengers being held captive in far-off Uganda. During this\nera, the IDF also mounted a successful bombing mission in Iraq to destroy\nSaddam Hussein's nuclear reactor. It was involved in the Lebanese Civil War,\ninitiating Operation Litani and later the 1982 Lebanon War, where the IDF\nousted Palestinian guerilla organizations from Lebanon. Palestinian militancy\nhas been the main focus of the IDF ever since, especially during the First and\nSecond Intifadas, Operation Defensive Shield, the Gaza War, Operation Pillar\nof Defense, and Operation Protective Edge, causing the IDF to change many of\nits values and publish the IDF Spirit. The Islamic Shia organization Hezbollah\nhas also been a growing threat,[15] against which the IDF fought an asymmetric\nconflict between 1982 and 2000, as well as a full-scale war in 2006.\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\nThe Israeli cabinet ratified the name \"Israel Defense Forces\" (Hebrew: \u05e6\u05b0\u05d1\u05b8\u05d0\n\u05d4\u05b7\u05d4\u05b2\u05d2\u05b8\u05e0\u05b8\u05d4 \u05dc\u05b0\u05d9\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c2\u05e8\u05b8\u05d0\u05b5\u05dc), _Tzva HaHagana LeYisra'el_, literally \"army for the\ndefense of Israel,\" on 26 May 1948. The other main contender was _Tzva\nYisra'el_ (Hebrew: \u05e6\u05b0\u05d1\u05b8\u05d0 \u05d9\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c2\u05e8\u05b8\u05d0\u05b5\u05dc). The name was chosen because it conveyed\nthe idea that the army's role was defense, and because it incorporated the\nname Haganah, the pre-state defensive organization upon which the new army was\nbased.[16] Among the primary opponents of the name were Minister Haim-Moshe\nShapira and the Hatzohar party, both in favor of _Tzva Yisra'el_.[16]\n\n## Organization[edit]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Flickr_-\n_Israel_Defense_Forces_-_Honor_Guard_at_IDF_Headquarters_for_Outgoing_Chief_of\n_Staff_Lt._Gen._Gabi_Ashkenazi.jpg/220px-Flickr_-_Israel_Defense_Forces_-_Hono\nr_Guard_at_IDF_Headquarters_for_Outgoing_Chief_of_Staff_Lt._Gen._Gabi_Ashkenaz\ni.jpg)\n\nIDF Kirya Compound, Tel Aviv\n\nAll branches of the IDF answer to a single General Staff. The Chief of the\nGeneral Staff is the only serving officer having the rank of Lieutenant\nGeneral (_Rav Aluf_). He reports directly to the Defense Minister and\nindirectly to the Prime Minister of Israel and the cabinet. Chiefs of Staff\nare formally appointed by the cabinet, based on the Defense Minister's\nrecommendation, for three years, but the government can vote to extend their\nservice to four (and in rare occasions even five) years. The current chief of\nstaff is Gadi Eizenkot. He replaced Benny Gantz in 2015.\n\n### Units[edit]\n\n**Land Forces** | **Air Forces**  \n---|---  \nHebrew | English | Commander | Hebrew | English | Commander  \n_Chulia_ | Fire Team | _Mashak Chulia_  \n(\"Fire Team Leader\")  \nCorporal or Sergeant | _Tayeset_ | Air Force Squadron | Captain or Major  \n_Kita_ | Squad / Section | _Mashak Kita_  \n(\"Squad / Section Leader\")  \nStaff Sergeant | _Kanaf_ | Air Forces Wing | Lieutenant-Colonel  \n_Machlekah_ | Platoon | _Mifaked Machlekah_ (\"Platoon Commander\")  \nLieutenant | _Lahak_ | Air Force Command | Colonel  \n_Plugah_ | Company | _Mifaked Plugah_ (\"Company Commander\")  \nCaptain  \n_Solil-l\u2019ah_ | Artillery Battery | Captain or Major  \n_Sayeret_ | Commando (Special Operations) | Captain or Major  \n_Gdud_ | Battalion | Lieutenant-Colonel  \n_Chativa_ | Brigade | Colonel  \n_Ugda_ | Division | (1948-1967) Major-General  \n(1968\u2013Present) Brigadier-General  \n_Gayis_ | Corps | Major-General  \n  \n### Structure[edit]\n\nThe IDF includes the following bodies (those whose respective heads are\nmembers of the General Staff are in bold):\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Structure_idf.png\n/550px-Structure_idf.png)\n\nStructure of the Israel Defense Forces (click to enlarge)\n\n#### Regional commands[edit]\n\n  * **Northern Command**\n  * **Central Command**\n  * **Southern Command**\n  * **Home Front Command**\n\n#### Arms[edit]\n\n**Ground Arm**\n\n  * Infantry Corps\n    * Paratroopers Brigade\n    * Golani Brigade\n    * Nahal Brigade\n    * Givati Brigade\n    * Kfir Brigade\n    * Bislamach Brigade\n  * Armor Corps\n    * 7th Sa'ar Armored Brigade\n    * 188th Barak Armored Brigade\n    * 401st Ikvot HaBarzel Armored Brigade\n    * 460th Sons of Light Armored Brigade\n  * Artillery Corps\n  * Combat Engineering Corps\n  * Combat Intelligence Collection Corps\n\n**Air and Space Arm**\n\n  * Air Force\n\n    \n\n  * Air Defense Network\n\n**Sea Arm**\n\n  * Israeli Navy\n\n#### Other bodies[edit]\n\n**Military:**\n\n  * **Military Academies**\n    * Tactical Command College\n    * Command and Staff College\n    * National Security College\n  * **Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories**\n  * **Financial Advisor to the Chief of Staff**\n  * **Military Secretary to the Prime Minister**\n\n**Civilian:**\n\n  * **Director-general of the Ministry of Defense**\n  * **Defense Establishment Comptroller Unit**\n  * **Administration for the Development of Weapons and the Technological Industry**\n  * **Engineering and Construction Department of the Ministry of Defense**\n|\n\n#### Branches and Troops[edit]\n\n**General Staff**\n\n  * **Planning Directorate**\n  * **Operations Directorate**\n    * IDF Spokesperson\n    * The Dado Center for Interdisciplinary Military Studies\n  * **Intelligence Directorate**\n    * Intelligence Corps\n    * Military Censor\n  * **Depth Headquarters**\n  * **Manpower Directorate**\n    * Military Police Corps\n    * Education and Youth Corps\n    * Adjutant Corps\n    * General Corps\n    * Military Rabbinate\n    * Women's Affairs advisor\n    * Manpower Planning and Administration brigade\n    * Individuals' Department\n    * Staff Department\n    * Chief Reserve Officer\n  * **Military Courts / Tribunals Unit**\n    * Military Court / Tribunal\n    * Military Advocate General\n    * Military Court of Appeals\n  * **Computer Service Directorate**\n    * Teleprocessing and Signal Corps (C4I Corps)\n  * **Technological and Logistics Directorate**\n    * Ordnance Corps\n    * Maintenance, Supply and Logistics Corps\n    * Medical Corps  \n---|---  \n  \n### Related bodies[edit]\n\nThe following bodies work closely with the IDF, but do not (or only partially)\nbelong to its formal structure.\n\n#### Security forces[edit]\n\n  * Intelligence Community\n\n    \n\n  * Shabak\n  * Mossad\n  * National Security Council\n\n  * Israeli police\n\n    \n\n  * Border Police\n\n  * Prison Service\n  * Knesset Guard\n|\n\n#### Development[edit]\n\n  * Israel Military Industries (IMI)\n  * Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI)\n  * Rafael Advanced Defense Systems\n  * Elbit Systems\n  * Elisra Group\n  * Soltam\n  * Plasan  \n---|---  \n  \n### Ranks, uniforms and insignia[edit]\n\n#### Ranks[edit]\n\nMain article: Israel Defense Forces ranks\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Dayan_w_Kuntila_Raid_c\nomm.jpg/220px-Dayan_w_Kuntila_Raid_comm.jpg)\n\nIsraeli officers of the Paratrooper Battalion 890 in 1955 with Moshe Dayan\n(standing, third from the left).

There are several dress uniforms depending on the season and the branch.\n\nThe service uniform for all ground forces personnel is olive green; navy and\nair force uniforms are beige (tan). The uniforms consist of a two-pocket\nshirt, combat trousers, sweater, jacket or blouse, and shoes or boots. The\nnavy also has an all white dress uniform. The green fatigues are the same for\nwinter and summer and heavy winter gear is issued as needed. Women's dress\nparallels the men's but may substitute a skirt for the trousers.\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Flickr_-\n_Israel_Defense_Forces_-_Officer_Course_for_Infantry_Command.jpg/220px-\nFlickr_-_Israel_Defense_Forces_-_Officer_Course_for_Infantry_Command.jpg)\n\nIDF female infantry soldiers\n\nHeadgear included a service cap for dress and semi-dress and a field cap or\nbush hat worn with fatigues. IDF personnel generally wear berets in lieu of\nthe service cap and there are many beret colors issued to IDF Servicemen and\nWomen. Paratroopers are issued a maroon beret, Golani brown, Givati purple,\nNahal lime green, Kfir camouflage, Combat Engineers gray, navy blue for IDF\nNaval and dark grey for IDF Air Force personnel. Other beret colors are: black\nfor armored corps, turquoise for artillery personnel; olive drab for infantry;\ngrey for combat engineers. For all other army personnel, except combat units,\nthe beret for men was green and for women, black. Women in the navy wore a\nblack beret with gold insignia. Males in the navy once wore a blue/black beret\nbut replaced it with the US Navy's sailor cap.\n\nSome corps or units have small variations in their uniforms\u00a0\u2013 for instance,\nmilitary policemen wear a white belt and police hat, Naval personnel have\ndress whites for parades, Paratroopers are issued a four pocket Tunic (shirt)\nmeant to be worn untucked with a pistol belt cinched tight around the waist\nover the shirt. The IDF air corps has a dress uniform consisting of a pale\nblue shirt with dark blue trousers. Similarly, while most IDF soldiers are\nissued black leather boots, certain units issue reddish-brown leather boots\nfor historical reasons\u00a0\u2014 the paratroopers, combat medics, Nahal and Kfir\nBrigades, as well as some SF units (Sayeret Matkal, Oketz, Duvdevan, Maglan,\nCounter-Terror School). Women were also formerly issued sandals, but this\npractice has ceased.\n\n#### Insignia[edit]\n\nMain article: Israel Defense Forces insignia\n\nIDF soldiers have three types of insignia (other than rank insignia) which\nidentify their corps, specific unit, and position.\n\nA pin attached to the beret identifies a soldier's corps. Soldiers serving in\nstaffs above corps level are often identified by the General Corps pin,\ndespite not officially belonging to it, or the pin of a related corps. New\nrecruits undergoing basic training (_tironut_) do not have a pin. Beret colors\nare also often indicative of the soldier's corps, although most non-combat\ncorps do not have their own beret, and sometimes wear the color of the corps\nto which the post they're stationed in belongs. Individual units are\nidentified by a shoulder tag attached to the left shoulder strap. Most units\nin the IDF have their own tags, although those that do not, generally use tags\nidentical to their command's tag (corps, directorate, or regional command).\n\nWhile one cannot always identify the position/job of a soldier, two optional\nfactors help make this identification: an aiguillette attached to the left\nshoulder strap and shirt pocket, and a pin indicating the soldier's work type\n(usually given by a professional course). Other pins may indicate the corps or\nadditional courses taken. Finally, an optional battle pin indicates a war that\na soldier has fought in.\n\n## Service[edit]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Flickr_-\n_Israel_Defense_Forces_-_163rd_IAF_Flight_Course_Graduates_%281%29.jpg/220px-\nFlickr_-_Israel_Defense_Forces_-\n_163rd_IAF_Flight_Course_Graduates_%281%29.jpg)\n\n163rd IAF Flight Course Graduates\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Flickr_-\n_Israel_Defense_Forces_-\n_Flight_School_Graduates_Receive_Their_New_Rankings_as_Air_Force_Officers.jpg\n/220px-Flickr_-_Israel_Defense_Forces_-\n_Flight_School_Graduates_Receive_Their_New_Rankings_as_Air_Force_Officers.jpg)\n\nIAF Flight academy graduates receive their ranks as air force officers\n\n### Military service routes[edit]\n\nThe military service is held in three different tracks:\n\n  * **Regular service** (\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05d7\u05d5\u05d1\u05d4) \u2013 mandatory military service which is held according to the Israeli security service law.\n  * **Permanent Service** (\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05e7\u05d1\u05e2) \u2013 military service which is held as part of a contractual agreement between the IDF and the permanent position holder.\n  * **Reserve service** (\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05de\u05d9\u05dc\u05d5\u05d0\u05d9\u05dd) \u2013 a military service in which citizens are called for active duty of at most a month every year (In accordance with the Reserve Service Law), for training activities and ongoing defense activities and especially for the purpose of increasing the military forces in case of a war.\n\nSometimes the IDF would also hold pre-military courses (\u05e7\u05d5\u05e8\u05e1 \u05e7\u05d3\u05dd \u05e6\u05d1\u05d0\u05d9 or \u05e7\u05d3\"\u05e6)\nfor soon to be regular service soldiers.\n\n### Special service routes[edit]\n\n  * **Shoher** (\u05e9\u05d5\u05d7\u05e8), a person enrolled in pre-military studies (High School, Technical College up to Eng degree, some of the \u05e7\u05d3\"\u05e5 courses) \u2013 after completing the 12th study year will do a 2-month boot-camp and, if allowed, enter a program of education to qualify as a Practical engineer, with at least two weeks of training following each study year. Successful candidates will continue for an Engineering Bachelor degree. Shoher will be enrolled into regular service if he dropped out before finished his P.A. education or in any finishing education stage (after High School, after P.A. or after receiving the bachelor's degree). Another example of a Shoher is a programmer that is under the programming course of **School for Computer Professions** (Hebrew: \u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05d4\u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \u05dc\u05de\u05e7\u05e6\u05d5\u05e2\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05de\u05d7\u05e9\u05d1\u200e, abbr. Basmach - \u05d1\u05e1\u05de\"\u05d7). The course usually lasts about 6 months, and at its peak, the Shoher receives a programmer badge.\n\nShoher will have the ability to serve in R&amp;D units without having the\nengineering credentials if an officer finds him as worthy and could recommend\nhim for the R&amp;D units, R&amp;D unit have the option to provide \"\u05e2\u05dc \u05ea\u05e7\u05df\n\u05de\u05d4\u05e0\u05d3\u05e1\" certificate for few selected personal to allow person to work on life\nsaving or flight equipment without having an Eng. license (the certificate\nisn't valid for medical R&amp;D machinery), the certificate is provided by the\nhighest in command in the research field (as an example for the Air Force it\nis the Chef of Equipment Group).\n\n  * **Civilian working for the IDF** (\u05d0\u05d6\u05e8\u05d7 \u05e2\u05d5\u05d1\u05d3 \u05e6\u05d4\"\u05dc), a civilian working for the military.\n\nThe Israeli Manpower Directorate (\u05d0\u05d2\u05e3 \u05de\u05e9\u05d0\u05d1\u05d9 \u05d0\u05e0\u05d5\u05e9) at the Israeli General Staff\nis the body which coordinates and assembles activities related to the control\nover human resources and its placement.\n\n#### Regular service[edit]\n\nMain article: Conscription in Israel\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Nahal-kumta.jpg/220px-\nNahal-kumta.jpg)\n\nIDF Nahal Brigade soldiers on their regular service\n\nNational military service is mandatory for all Israeli citizens over the age\nof 18, although Arab (but not Druze) citizens are exempted if they so please,\nand other exceptions may be made on religious, physical or psychological\ngrounds (see Profile 21). The Tal law, which exempts ultra-orthodox Jews from\nservice, has been the subject of several court cases as well as considerable\nlegislative controversy.\n\nUntil the draft of July 2015, men served three years in the IDF. Men drafted\nas of July 2015 and later will serve 2 years and 8 months (32 months), with\nsome roles requiring an additional 4 months of Permanent service. Women serve\ntwo years. The IDF women who volunteer for several combat positions often\nserve for three years, due to the longer period of training. Women in other\npositions, such as programmers, who also require lengthy training time, may\nalso serve three years.\n\nSome distinguished recruits are selected to be trained in order to eventually\nbecome members of special forces units. Every brigade in the IDF has its own\nspecial force branch.\n\nCareer soldiers are paid on average NIS 23,000 a month, fifty times the NIS\n460 paid to conscripts.[21]\n\nIn 1998-2000, only about 9% of those who refused to serve in the Israeli\nmilitary were granted exemption.[22]\n\n#### Permanent service[edit]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Flickr_-\n_Israel_Defense_Forces_-_The_IDF_Honors_Its_Reservists.jpg/220px-Flickr_-\n_Israel_Defense_Forces_-_The_IDF_Honors_Its_Reservists.jpg)\n\nIDF Reservists train in the Golan Heights\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/IDF_soldier_put_on_tef\nillin.jpg/220px-IDF_soldier_put_on_tefillin.jpg)\n\nIDF soldier put on tefillin and prays.\n\nPermanent service is designed for soldiers who choose to continue serving in\nthe army after their regular service, for a short or long period, and in many\ncases making the military their career. Permanent service usually begins\nimmediately after the mandatory Regular service period, but there are also\nsoldiers who get released from military at the end of the mandatory Regular\nservice period and who get recruited back to the military as Permanent service\nsoldiers in a later period.\n\nPermanent service is based on a contractual agreement between the IDF and the\npermanent position holder. The service contract defines how long the soldier's\nservice would be, and towards the end of the contract period a discussion may\nrise on the extension of the soldier's service duration. Many times, regular\nservice soldiers are required to commit to a permanent service after the\nmandatory Regular service period, in exchange for assigning them in military\npositions which require a long training period.\n\nIn exchange for the Permanent service, the Permanent service soldiers receive\nfull wages, and when serving for a long period as a permanent service soldier,\nthey are also entitled for a pension from the army. This right is given to the\nPermanent service soldiers in a relatively early stage of their life in\ncomparison to the rest of the Israeli retirees.\n\n#### Reserve service[edit]\n\nMain article: Reserve duty (Israel)\n\nAfter personnel complete their regular service, they are either granted\npermanent exemption from military service, or assigned a position in the\nreserve forces. There is no distinction between assignment of men or women to\nreserve service.\n\nThe IDF may call up reservists for:\n\n  * reserve service of up to one month every three years, until the age of 40 (enlisted) or 45 (officers). Reservists may volunteer after this age, with approval of the Manpower Directorate.\n  * immediate active duty in war time.\n\nIn most cases, the reserve duty is carried out in the same unit for years, in\nmany cases the same unit as the active service and by the same people. Many\nsoldiers who have served together in active service continue to meet in\nreserve duty for years after their discharge, causing reserve duty to become a\nstrong male bonding experience in Israeli society.\n\nAlthough still available for call-up in times of crisis, most Israeli men, and\nvirtually all women, do not actually perform reserve service in any given\nyear. Units do not always call up all of their reservists every year, and a\nvariety of exemptions are available if called for regular reserve service.\nVirtually no exemptions exist for reservists called up in a time of crisis,\nbut experience has shown that in such cases (most recently, the 2014 Operation\nProtective Edge) exemptions are rarely requested or exercised; units generally\nachieve recruitment rates above those considered fully manned.\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Israel_4_021.Israelic_\nSoldier.jpg/220px-Israel_4_021.Israelic_Soldier.jpg)\n\nThe Israel Border Police (_Magav_) is responsible for security in urban or\nrural areas\n\nLegislation (Approved in April 2008) has reformed the reserve service,\nlowering the maximum service age to 40 for enlisted, and 45 for officers,\ndesignating it as an emergency and security force (disallowing routine duties\nthat may be carried out by the active forces), as well as many other changes\nto the structure (although the Defense Minister can suspend any portion of it\nat any time for security reasons). The age threshold for many reservists whose\npositions are listed and updated yearly by the Knesset through the Occupations\nexecutive order is fixed at 45 or 49, depending on their military occupation\nand position.\n\n### Non-IDF service[edit]\n\nOther than the National Service (_Sherut Leumi_), IDF conscripts may serve in\nbodies other than the IDF in a number of ways.\n\nThe combat option is Israel Border Police (_Magav_ \u2013 the exact translation\nfrom Hebrew means \"border guard\") service, part of the Israel Police. Some\nsoldiers complete their IDF combat training and later undergo additional\ncounter terror and Border Police training. These are assigned to Border Police\nunits. The Border Police units fight side by side with the regular IDF combat\nunits though to a lower capacity. They are also responsible for security in\nheavy urban areas such as Jerusalem and security and crime fighting in rural\nareas.\n\nNon-combat services include the Mandatory Police Service (_Shaham_) program,\nwhere youth serve in the Israeli Police, Israel Prison Service, or other wings\nof the Israeli Security Forces instead of the regular army service.\n\n### Women[edit]\n\nMain article: Women in the Israel Defense Forces\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Flickr_-\n_Israel_Defense_Forces_-_Karakal_Winter_Training.jpg/220px-Flickr_-\n_Israel_Defense_Forces_-_Karakal_Winter_Training.jpg)\n\nThe unisex Caracal Battalion, which serves in routine security missions\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Flickr_-\n_Israel_Defense_Forces_-_Female_Soldiers_Unload_their_Weapons.jpg/220px-\nFlickr_-_Israel_Defense_Forces_-_Female_Soldiers_Unload_their_Weapons.jpg)\n\nIDF shooting instructors, a common role for women in the IDF[23]\n\nIsrael is one of only a few nations that conscript women or deploy them in\ncombat roles, although in practice, women can avoid conscription through a\nreligious exemption and over a third of Israeli women do so.[24] As of 2010,\n88% of all roles in the IDF are open to female candidates. and women could be\nfound in 69% of all IDF positions.[25] The IDF concedes that fewer than 4\npercent of women are in combat positions. Rather, they are concentrated in\n\"combat-support\" positions which command a lower compensation and status than\ncombat positions.[26]\n\nCivilian pilot and aeronautical engineer Alice Miller successfully petitioned\nthe High Court of Justice to take the Israeli Air Force pilot training exams,\nafter being rejected on grounds of gender. Though president Ezer Weizman, a\nformer IAF commander, told Miller that she would be better off staying home\nand darning socks, the court eventually ruled in 1996 that the IAF could not\nexclude qualified women from pilot training. Even though Miller would not pass\nthe exams, the ruling was a watershed, opening doors for women in new IDF\nroles. Female legislators took advantage of the momentum to draft a bill\nallowing women to volunteer for any position, if they could qualify.[27]\n\nIn 2000, the Equality amendment to the Military Service law stated that the\nright of women to serve in any role in the IDF is equal to the right of\nmen.[28] A study of women in the IDF from 2002 to 2005 found that women often\nexhibit \"superior skills\" in discipline, motivation and marksmanship. However,\nthe study noted that women still face gender discrimination in the IDF.[29]\nWomen have taken part in Israel\u2019s military before and since the founding of\nthe state in 1948.[30] Women started to enter combat support and light combat\nroles in a few areas, including the Artillery Corps, infantry units and\narmored divisions. A few platoons named Karakal were formed for men and women\nto serve together in light infantry. By 2000 Karakal became a full-fledged\nbattalion, with a second mixed-gender battalion, Lions of the Jordan (\u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea\n\u05d4\u05d9\u05e8\u05d3\u05df, Arayot Ha-Yarden) formed in 2015. Many women would also join the Border\nPolice.[27]\n\nIn June 2011, Maj. General Orna Barbivai became the first female major general\nin the IDF, replacing head of the directorate Maj. General Avi Zamir. Barbivai\nstated, \"I am proud to be the first woman to become a major general and to be\npart of an organization in which equality is a central principle. 90 percent\nof jobs in the IDF are open to women and I am sure that there are other women\nwho will continue to break down barriers.\"[31][32]\n\nIn 2013, the IDF announced they would, for the first time, allow a (MTF)\ntransgender woman to serve in the army as a female soldier.[33]\n\nElana Sztokman notes it would be \"difficult to claim that women are equals in\nthe IDF.\" \"And tellingly, there is only one female general in the entire IDF,\"\nshe adds.[26] In 2012 religious soldiers claimed they were promised they would\nnot have to listen to women sing or lecture, but IAF Chief Rabbi Moshe Raved\nresigned because male religious soldiers were being required to do so.[34] In\nJanuary 2015 three women IDF singers performed in one of the IDF's units. The\nperformance was first disrupted by fifteen religious soldiers, who left in\nprotest and then the Master Sergeant forced them to end the performance\nbecause it was disturbing the religious soldiers. An IDF spokesperson\nannounced an investigation of the incident: \"We are aware of the incident and\nalready began examining it. The exclusion of woman is not consistent with the\nvalues of the IDF.\"[35] Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon has also arranged for\nwomen to be excluded from recruitment centers catering to religious males.[36]\nAs the IDF recruits more religious soldiers, the rights of male religious\nsoldiers and of women in the IDF come into conflict. Brig. Gen. Zeev Lehrer,\nwho served on the chief of staff's panel of the integration of women, noted\n\"There is a clear process of 'religionization\u2019 in the army, and the story of\nthe women is a central piece of it. There are very strong pressures at work to\nhalt the process of integrating women into the army, and they are coming from\nthe direction of religion.\"[37] Gender segregation or sex segregation is\nallowed in the IDF, and the IDF reached what it considers a \"new milestone\" in\n2006, creating the first company of soldiers segregated in an all female unit,\nthe Nachshol (Hebrew for \"giant wave\") Reconnaissance Company. \"We are the\nonly unit in the world made up entirely of female combat soldiers,\" said\nNachshol Company Commander Cpt. Dana Ben-Ezra. \"Our effectiveness and the\ndividends we earn are the factors by which we are measured, not our\ngender.\"[38]\n\n## Minorities in the IDF[edit]\n\nNon-Jewish minorities tended to serve in one of several special units: the\nMinorities Unit, also known as Unit 300; the Druze Reconnaissance Unit; and\nthe Trackers Unit, which comprised mostly Negev Bedouins. In 1982, the IDF\ngeneral staff decided to integrate the armed forces by opening up other units\nto minorities, while placing some Jewish conscripts in the Minorities Unit.\nUntil 1988, the intelligence corps and the air force remained closed to\nminorities.\n\n### Druze and Circassians[edit]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/DruzeSoldier.jpg\n/220px-DruzeSoldier.jpg)\n\nDruze commander of the IDF Herev battalion\n\nAlthough Israel has a majority of Jewish soldiers, large numbers of Druze and\nCircassian men are subject to mandatory conscription to the IDF just like\nIsraeli Jews.[39] Originally, they served in the framework of a special unit\ncalled \"The Minorities' Unit\", which operated until 2015 in the form of the\nindependent Herev (\"Sword\") battalion. However, since the 1980s, Druze\nsoldiers have increasingly protested this practice, which they considered a\nmeans of segregating them and denying them access to elite units (like sayeret\nunits). The army has increasingly admitted Druze soldiers to regular combat\nunits and promoted them to higher ranks from which they had been previously\nexcluded. In 2015, Rav Aluf Gadi Eizenkot has ordered the unit's closure in\norder to assimilate the Druze soldiers no differently than Jewish soldiers, as\npart of an ongoing reorganization of the army. In recent years, several Druze\nofficers have reached ranks as high as Major General and many have received\ncommendations for distinguished service. In proportion to their numbers, the\nDruze people achieve much higher\u2014documented\u2014levels in the Israeli army than\nother soldiers. Nevertheless, some Druze still charge that discrimination\ncontinues, such as exclusion from the Air Force, although the official low\nsecurity classification for Druze has been abolished for some time. The first\nDruze aircraft navigator completed his training course in 2005; his identity\nis protected as are those of all air force pilots. During the Israeli War of\nIndependence, many Druze who had initially sided with the Arabs deserted their\nranks to either return to their villages or side with Israel in various\ncapacities.[40]\n\nSince the late 1970s, the Druze Initiative Committee, centered at the village\nof Beit Jan and linked to the Israeli Communist Party, has campaigned to\nabolish Druze conscription.\n\nMilitary service is a tradition among some of the Druze population, with most\nopposition in Druze communities of the Golan Heights; 83 percent of Druze boys\nserve in the army, according to the IDF's statistics.[41] According to the\nIsraeli army, 369 Druze soldiers have been killed in combat operations since\n1948.[42]\n\n### Bedouins and Israeli Arabs[edit]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Bedouin_IDF1949.jpg\n/220px-Bedouin_IDF1949.jpg)\n\nBedouin soldiers in 1949\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Israeli_soldiers_and_A\nrabs.jpg/220px-Israeli_soldiers_and_Arabs.jpg)\n\nIsraeli Arab soldiers, serving in the Galilee in 1978\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Flickr_-\n_Israel_Defense_Forces_-_Bedouin_Soldier_with_Schoolchild.jpg/220px-Flickr_-\n_Israel_Defense_Forces_-_Bedouin_Soldier_with_Schoolchild.jpg)\n\nBedouin Desert Reconnaissance Battalion, visiting an Arab school\n\nBy law, all Israeli citizens are subject to conscription. The Defense Minister\nhas complete discretion to grant exemption to individual citizens or classes\nof citizens. A long-standing policy dating to Israel's early years extends an\nexemption to all other Israeli minorities (most notably Israeli Arabs).\nHowever, there is a long-standing government policy of encouraging Bedouins to\nvolunteer and of offering them various inducements, and in some impoverished\nBedouin communities a military career seems one of the few means of (relative)\nsocial mobility available. Also, Muslims and Christians are accepted as\nvolunteers, even at an age greater than 18.[43]\n\nFrom among non-Bedouin Arab citizens, the number of volunteers for military\nservice\u2014some Christian Arabs and even a few Muslim Arabs\u2014is minute, and the\ngovernment makes no special effort to increase it. Six Israeli Arabs have\nreceived orders of distinction as a result of their military service; of them\nthe most famous is a Bedouin officer, Lieutenant Colonel Abd el-Majid Hidr\n(also known as Amos Yarkoni), who received the Order of Distinction. Vahid el\nHuzil was the first Bedouin to be a battalion commander.[44][45] Recently, a\nBedouin officer was promoted to the rank of Colonel.[_citation needed_]\n\nUntil the second term of Yitzhak Rabin as Prime Minister (1992\u20131995), social\nbenefits given to families in which at least one member (including a\ngrandfather, uncle or cousin) had served at some time in the armed forces were\nsignificantly higher than to \"non-military\" families, which was considered a\nmeans of blatant discrimination between Jews and Arabs. Rabin had led the\nabolition of the measure, in the teeth of strong opposition from the Right. At\npresent, the only official advantage from military service is the attaining of\nsecurity clearance and serving in some types of government positions (in most\ncases, security-related), as well as some indirect benefits.\n\nRather than perform army service, Israeli Arab youths have the option to\nvolunteer to national service and receive benefits similar to those received\nby discharged soldiers. The volunteers are generally allocated to Arab\npopulations, where they assist with social and community matters. As of\n2010[update] there are 1,473 Arabs volunteering for national service.\nAccording to sources in the national service administration, Arab leaders are\ncounseling youths to refrain from performing services to the state. According\nto a National Service official, \"For years the Arab leadership has demanded,\njustifiably, benefits for Arab youths similar to those received by discharged\nsoldiers. Now, when this opportunity is available, it is precisely these\nleaders who reject the state's call to come and do the service, and receive\nthese benefits\".[46]\n\nAlthough Arabs are not obligated to serve in IDF, any Arab can volunteer. A\nMuslim Arab woman is currently serving as a medic with unit 669.[47]\n\nCpl. Elinor Joseph from Haifa became the first female Arab combat soldier for\nIDF. Elinor said \"there was a Katyusha [rocket] that fell near my house and\nalso hurt Arabs. If someone would tell me that serving in the IDF means\nkilling Arabs, I remind them that Arabs also kill Arabs.\"[48]\n\nOther Arab-Muslim officers in the IDF are Hisham Abu Varia, who is currently a\nSecond Lieutenant,[49] and Major Ala Wahib, who is currently the highest\nranking Muslim officer in the IDF.[50]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Falasha_makstyle.jpg\n/150px-Falasha_makstyle.jpg)\n\nAn Ethiopian-Jewish soldier\n\nIn October 2012, the IDF promoted Mona Abdo to become the first female\nChristian Arab to the rank of combat commander. Abdo had voluntarily enlisted\nin the IDF, which her family had encouraged, and transferred from the Ordnance\nCorps to the Caracal Battalion, a mixed-gender unit with both Jewish and Arab\nsoldiers.[51]\n\nRecently, there has been an increase of Israeli Christian Arabs joining the\narmy.[52]\n\n### Ethiopian Jews[edit]\n\nThe IDF carried out extended missions in Ethiopia and neighboring states,\nwhose purpose was to protect Ethiopian Jews (Beta Israel) and to help their\nimmigration to Israel.[53] The IDF adopted policies and special activities for\nabsorption and integration of Ethiopian immigrant soldiers, which resulted in\ngreat positive impact on the achievements and integration of those soldiers in\nthe army as well as Israeli society in general.[54][55] Statistical research\nshowed that the Ethiopian soldiers are esteemed as excellent soldiers and many\naspire to be recruited to combat units.[56]\n\n### Haredim[edit]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/NetzahYehudafield.jpg\n/220px-NetzahYehudafield.jpg)\n\nIDF soldiers of the religious 97th \"Netzah Yehuda\" Infantry Battalion\n\nMen in the Haredi community may choose to defer service while enrolled in\n_yeshivot_ (see Tal committee); many avoid conscription altogether. This\nspecial arrangement is called Torato Omanuto, and has given rise to tensions\nbetween the Israeli religious and secular communities. While options exist for\nHaredim to serve in the IDF in an atmosphere conducive to their religious\nconvictions, most Haredim do not choose to serve in the IDF.\n\nHaredi males have the option of serving in the 97th \"Netzah Yehuda\" Infantry\nBattalion. This unit is a standard IDF infantry battalion focused on the Jenin\nregion. To allow Haredi soldiers to serve, the Netzah Yehuda military bases\nfollow the highest standards of Jewish dietary laws; the only women permitted\non these bases are wives of soldiers and officers. Additionally, some Haredim\nserve in the IDF via the Hesder system, principally designed for the Religious\nZionist sector; it is a 5-year program which includes 2 years of religious\nstudies, 1\u00bd years of military service and 1\u00bd years of religious studies during\nwhich the soldiers can be recalled to active duty at any moment. Haredi\nsoldiers are permitted to join other units of the IDF as well, but rarely do.\n\nThe IDF has identified an urgent gap of hundreds of soldiers in their\ntechnical units that might be filled by the Haredi. The IAF is currently using\ndefense contractors to fill in the gaps and continue operations.[57]\n\nAlthough the IDF claims it will not discriminate against women, it is offering\nHaredim \"women free and secular free\" recruitment centers. Defense Minister\nMoshe Ya'alon expressed his willingness to relax regulations to meet the\ndemands of ultra-Orthodox rabbis. Regulations regarding gender equality had\nalready been relaxed so that Haredim could be assured that men would not\nreceive physical exams from female medical staff.[58]\n\n### LGBT people[edit]\n\nFurther information: Sexual orientation and military service \u00a7 Israel\n\nIsrael is one of 24 nations that allow openly gay individuals to serve in the\nmilitary. Since the early 1990s, sexual identity presents no formal barrier in\nterms of soldiers' military specialization or eligibility for\npromotion.[59][60]\n\nUntil the 1980s, the IDF tended to discharge soldiers who were openly gay. In\n1983, the IDF permitted homosexuals to serve, but banned them from\nintelligence and top-secret positions. A decade later, Professor Uzi Even,[61]\nan IDF reserves officer and chairman of Tel Aviv University's Chemistry\nDepartment revealed that his rank had been revoked and that he had been barred\nfrom researching sensitive topics in military intelligence, solely because of\nhis sexual orientation. His testimony to the Knesset in 1993 raised a\npolitical storm, forcing the IDF to remove such restrictions against gays.[59]\n\nThe chief of staff's policy states that it is strictly forbidden to harm or\nhurt anyone's dignity or feeling based on their gender or sexual orientation\nin any way, including signs, slogans, pictures, poems, lectures, any means of\nguidance, propaganda, publishing, voicing, and utterance. Moreover, gays in\nthe IDF have additional rights, such as the right to take a shower alone if\nthey want to. According to a University of California, Santa Barbara\nstudy,[61] a brigadier general stated that Israelis show a \"great tolerance\"\nfor gay soldiers. Consul David Saranga at the Israeli Consulate in New York,\nwho was interviewed by the _St. Petersburg Times_, said, \"It's a non-issue.\nYou can be a very good officer, a creative one, a brave one, and be gay at the\nsame time.\"[59]\n\nA study published by the Israel Gay Youth (IGY) Movement in January 2012 found\nthat half of the homosexual soldiers who serve in the IDF suffer from violence\nand homophobia, although the head of the group said that \"I am happy to say\nthat the intention among the top brass is to change that.\"[62]\n\n### Deaf and hard-of-hearing people[edit]\n\nIsrael is the only country in the world that requires the deaf and hard-of-\nhearing people to serve in the conscription or military.[63] Sign language\ninterpreters are provided during training, and many of them serve in the non-\ncombat capacities such as mappers, office work, and the like. The deaf and\nhard-of-hearing people who have served in the IDF have better opportunities in\nemployment, housing, education, and other areas than those who do not serve.\nIn addition, they gain a greater respect and recognition for their service and\ncontribution to the country as well as stronger self-esteem and\nmotivation.[64]\n\n### Vegans[edit]\n\nAccording to a Care2 report, vegans in the IDF may refuse vaccination if they\noppose animal testing. They are provided with special allowances to buy their\nown food. They are also given artificial leather boots and a black fleece\nberet.[65]\n\n### Volunteers[edit]\n\nIn cases when a citizen cannot be normally drafted by the law (old age, served\nas a soldier in a different country, severe health problems, handicaps,\nautism, etc.), the person could enroll as a volunteer in places where his\nknowledge can be used or in cases where there is a base that accepts volunteer\nservice from one day per week up to full 24/7 service based upon that person's\nabilities and wishes.\n\n## Overseas volunteers[edit]\n\nNon-immigrating foreign volunteers typically serve with the IDF in one of five\nways:\n\n  * The Mahal program targets young non-Israeli Jews or Israeli citizens who grew up abroad (men younger than 24 and women younger than 21). The program consists typically of 18 months of IDF service, including a lengthy training for those in combat units or (for 18 months) one month of non-combat training and additional two months of learning Hebrew after enlisting, if necessary. There are two additional subcategories of Mahal, both geared solely for religious men: Mahal Nahal Haredi (18 months), and Mahal Hesder, which combines yeshiva study of 5 months with IDF service of 16 months, for a total of 21 months. Similar IDF programs exist for Israeli overseas residents. To be accepted as a Mahal Volunteer, one must be of Jewish descent (at least one Jewish grandparent).\n  * Sar-El, an organization subordinate to the Israeli Logistics Corps, provides a volunteer program for non-Israeli citizens who are 17 years or older (or 15 if accompanied by a parent). The program is also aimed at Israeli citizens, aged 30 years or older, living abroad who did not serve in the Israeli Army and who now wish to finalize their status with the military. The program usually consists of three weeks of volunteer service on different rear army bases, doing non-combative work.\n  * Garin Tzabar offers a program mainly for Israelis who emigrated with their parents to the United States at a young age. Although a basic knowledge of the Hebrew language is not mandatory, it is helpful. Of all the programs listed, only Garin Tzabar requires full-length service in the IDF. The program is set up in stages: first the participants go through five seminars in their country of origin, then have an absorption period in Israel at a kibbutz. Each delegation is adopted by a kibbutz in Israel and has living quarters designated for it. The delegation shares responsibilities in the kibbutz when on military leave. Participants start the program three months before being enlisted in the army at the beginning of August.\n  * Marva is short-term basic training for two months.\n  * Lev LaChayal is a program based at Yeshivat Lev Hatorah which takes a holistic approach to preparation for service. Being as ready as possible for integrating into Israeli culture, handling the physical challenges of the military, and maintaining religious values require a multi-pronged approach.

The article was meant as an \"extension of the\nclassical Just War Theory\", and as a \"[needed] third model\" or missing\nparadigm besides which of \"classical war (army) and law enforcement\n(police).\", resulting in a \"doctrine (...) on the background of the IDF fight\nagainst acts and activities of terror performed by Palestinian individuals and\norganizations.\"[69]\n\nIn this article, Kasher and Yadlin came to the conclusion that targeted\nkillings of terrorists were justifiable, even at the cost of hitting nearby\ncivilians. In a 2009 interview to _Haaretz_, Asa Kasher later confirmed,\npointing to the fact that in an area in which the IDF does not have effective\nsecurity control (e.g., Gaza, vs. Est-Jerusalem), soldiers' lives protection\ntakes priority over avoiding injury to enemy civilians.[70] Some, along with\nAvishai Margalit and Michael Walzer, have recused this argument, advancing\nthat such position was \"contrary to centuries of theorizing about the morality\nof war as well as international humanitarian law\",[71] since drawing \"a sharp\nline between combatants and noncombatants\" would be \"the only morally relevant\ndistinction that all those involved in a war can agree on.\"[72]\n\nThe article was intended to (then Chief of Staff) Moshe Ya'alon, to serve as a\nbasis for a new \"code of conduct\". Although Moshe Ya'alon did endorse the\narticle's views, and is reported to have presented it numerous times before\nmilitary forums, it was never actually turned into a binding IDF document or\nan actual \"code\", neither by Ya'alon nor its successors. However, the document\nhave since reportedly been adapted to serve as educational material, designed\nto emphasizes the right behavior in low intensity warfare against terrorists,\nwhere soldiers must operate within a civilian population.[73]\n\nAs of today \"The Spirit of the IDF\" (cf. supra) is still considered the only\nbiding moral code that formally applies to the IDF troops. In 2009, Amos\nYadlin (then head of Military Intelligence) suggested that the article he co-\nauthored with Asa Kasher be ratified as a formal binding code, arguing that\n\"the current code ['The Spirit of the IDF'] does not sufficiently address one\nof the army's most pressing challenges: asymmetric warfare against terrorist\norganizations that operate amid a civilian population\".[74]\n\nThe 11 key points highlighted in the article and educational material\nmentioned above:\n\n  1. Military action can be taken only against military targets.\n  2. The use of force must be proportional.\n  3. Soldiers may only use weaponry they were issued by the IDF.\n  4. Anyone who surrenders cannot be attacked.\n  5. Only those who are properly trained can interrogate prisoners.\n  6. Soldiers must accord dignity and respect to the Palestinian population and those arrested.\n  7. Soldiers must give appropriate medical care, when conditions allow, to themselves and to enemies.\n  8. Pillaging is absolutely and totally illegal.\n  9. Soldiers must show proper respect for religious and cultural sites and artifacts.\n  10. Soldiers must protect international aid workers, including their property and vehicles.\n  11. Soldiers must report all violations of this code.\n\n## Command and Control[edit]\n\nAccording to the Israeli _Basic Law: The IDF_ adopted in 1976, the IDF is\nsubject to the authority of the Government. The Minister in charge of the IDF\non behalf of the Government is the Minister of Defense. The supreme command\nlevel in the military, the Chief of the General Staff, the military's\nCommander in Chief, is appointed by and subject to the authority of the\ncivilian Government and is subordinate to the Minister of Defense (not the\nMinistry of Defense itself).\n\nHowever, in the years after the establishment of Israel, the Military\nestablishment enjoyed a degree of independence given to it by Ben-Gurion. This\nwas evident in the attendance of the Chief of General Staff in Cabinet and\nsecurity Cabinet meetings as an equal and not as a subordinate. Even after the\nAgranat Commission inquiry following the 1973 Yom Kippur War, when the roles,\nthe powers, and the duties of the Prime Minister, Defense Minister and Chief\nof General Staff were clarified and the rules and standards of monitoring\nwhere established between the military and the political spheres, the military\nstill continued to enjoy an overlarge status on the expense of the civilian\nauthority.\n\n## Budget[edit]\n\nDuring 1950\u201366, Israel spent an average of 9% of its GDP on defense. Defense\nexpenditures increased dramatically after both the 1967 and 1973 wars. They\nreached a high of about 24% of GDP in the 1980s, but have since come down\nsignificantly, following the signing of peace agreements with Jordan and\nEgypt.\n\nOn 30 September 2009 Defense Minister Ehud Barak, Finance Minister Yuval\nSteinitz and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu endorsed an additional NIS 1.5\nbillion for the defense budget to help Israel address problems regarding Iran.\nThe budget changes came two months after Israel had approved its current two-\nyear budget. The defense budget in 2009 stood at NIS 48.6 billion and NIS 53.2\nbillion for 2010 \u2013 the highest amount in Israel's history. The figure\nconstituted 6.3% of expected gross domestic product and 15.1% of the overall\nbudget, even before the planned NIS 1.5 billion addition.[75]\n\nHowever, in 2011, the prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu reversed course and\nmoved to make significant cuts in the defense budget in order to pay for\nsocial programs.[76] The General Staff concluded that the proposed cuts\nendangered the battle readiness of the armed forces.[77] In 2012, Israel spent\n$15.2 billion on its armed forces, one of the highest ratios of defense\nspending to GDP among developed countries ($1,900 per person). However,\nIsrael's spending per capita is below that of the USA.[78]\n\n## Weapons and equipment[edit]\n\nMain articles: Military equipment of Israel and Defense industry of Israel\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/F-15I_Ra%27am.jpg/220p\nx-F-15I_Ra%27am.jpg)\n\nIsraeli Air Force F-15I Ra'am\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/INS_Lahav.jpg/220px-\nINS_Lahav.jpg)\n\nIsraeli Navy Sa'ar 5-class corvette INS _Lahav_\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Merkava4m-Windbreaker-\n0036a.jpg/220px-Merkava4m-Windbreaker-0036a.jpg)\n\nMerkava Mark 4m with Trophy active protection system\n\n### Military technology[edit]\n\nThe IDF possesses top-of-the-line weapons and computer systems. Some gear\ncomes from the US (with some equipment modified for IDF use) such as the M4A1\nand M16 assault rifles, the M24 SWS 7.62\u00a0mm bolt action sniper rifle, the\nSR-25 7.62\u00a0mm semi-automatic sniper rifle, the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting\nFalcon fighter jets, and the AH-1 Cobra and AH-64D Apache attack helicopters.\nIsrael has also developed its own independent weapons industry, which has\ndeveloped weapons and vehicles such as the Merkava battle tank series, Nesher\nand Kfir fighter aircraft, and various small arms such as the Galil and Tavor\nassault rifles, and the Uzi submachine gun. Israel has also installed a\nvariant of the Samson RCWS, a remote controlled weapons platform, which can\ninclude machine guns, grenade launchers, and anti-tank missiles on a remotely\noperated turret, in pillboxes along the Israeli Gaza Strip barrier intended to\nprevent Palestinian militants from entering its territory.[79][80] Israel has\ndeveloped observation balloons equipped with sophisticated cameras and\nsurveillance systems used to thwart terror attacks from Gaza.[81] The IDF also\npossesses advanced combat engineering equipment which include the IDF\nCaterpillar D9 armored bulldozer, IDF Puma CEV, Tzefa Shiryon and CARPET\nminefield breaching rockets, and a variety of robots and explosive devices.\n\nThe IDF also has several large internal research and development departments,\nand it purchases many technologies produced by the Israeli security industries\nincluding IAI, IMI, Elbit Systems, Rafael, and dozens of smaller firms. Many\nof these developments have been battle-tested in Israel's numerous military\nengagements, making the relationship mutually beneficial, the IDF getting\ntailor-made solutions and the industries a good reputation.[_citation needed_]\n\nIn response to the price overruns on the US Littoral Combat Ship program,\nIsrael is considering producing their own warships, which would take a\ndecade[82] and depend on diverting US financing to the project.[83]\n\n### Main developments[edit]\n\nIsrael's military technology is most famous for its firearms, armored fighting\nvehicles (tanks, tank-converted armored personnel carriers (APCs), armoured\nbulldozers, etc.), unmanned aerial vehicles, and rocketry (missiles and\nrockets). Israel also has manufactured aircraft including the Kfir (reserve),\nIAI Lavi (canceled), and the IAI Phalcon Airborne early warning System, and\nnaval systems (patrol and missile ships). Much of the IDF's electronic systems\n(intelligence, communication, command and control, navigation etc.) are\nIsraeli-developed, including many systems installed on foreign platforms (esp.\naircraft, tanks and submarines), as are many of its precision-guided\nmunitions. Israel is the world's largest exporter of drones.[84]\n\nIsrael Military Industries (IMI) is known for its firearms. The IMI Galil, the\nUzi, the IMI Negev light machine gun and the new Tavor TAR-21 Bullpup assault\nrifle are used by the IDF.\n\nIsrael is the only country in the world with an operational anti-ballistic\nmissile defense system on the national level \u2013 the Arrow system, jointly\nfunded and produced by Israel and the United States. The Iron Dome system\nagainst short-range rockets is operational and proved to be successful.\nDavid's Sling, an anti-missile system designed to counter medium range rockets\nis under development. Israel has also worked with the US on development of a\ntactical high energy laser system against medium range rockets (called\nNautilus or THEL).\n\nIsrael has the independent capability of launching reconnaissance satellites\ninto orbit, a capability shared with Russia, the United States, the United\nKingdom, France, South Korea, Italy, Germany, the People's Republic of China,\nIndia, Japan, Brazil and Ukraine. Israeli security industries developed both\nthe satellites (Ofeq) and the launchers (Shavit).\n\nIsrael is known to have developed nuclear weapons.[85] Israel does not\nofficially acknowledge its nuclear weapons program. It is thought Israel\npossesses between one hundred and four hundred nuclear warheads.[85][86] It is\nbelieved that Jericho intercontinental ballistic missiles are capable of\ndelivering nuclear warheads with a superior degree of accuracy and a range of\n11,500\u00a0km.[87] Israeli F-15 and F-16 fighter-bomber aircraft also have been\ncited as possible nuclear delivery systems.[88][89][90] The U.S. Air Force\nF-15 has tactical nuclear weapon capability.[91] It has been asserted that\nDolphin submarines have been adapted to carry Popeye Turbo Submarine-launched\ncruise missiles with nuclear warheads, so as to give Israel a second strike\ncapacity.[92][93]\n\nFrom 2006 Israel deployed the Wolf Armoured Vehicle APC for use in urban\nwarfare and to protect VIPs.\n\n  *

female soldiers on parade, Jerusalem, 1968\n\nYom Hazikaron, Israel's day of remembrance for fallen soldiers, is observed on\nthe 4th day of the month of Iyar of the Hebrew calendar, the day before the\ncelebration of Independence Day. Memorial services are held in the presence of\nIsrael's top military personnel. A two-minute siren is heard at 11:00, which\nmarks the opening of the official military memorial ceremonies and private\nremembrance gatherings at each cemetery where soldiers are buried. Many\nIsraelis visit the graves of family members and friends who were killed in\naction. On the evening before the remembrance day all shops, restaurants and\nentertainment places must close gates to the public no later than 7 P.M. (the\nsame routine and law applies to the day of remembrance of the Holocaust which\ntakes place a week earlier).\n\nThe main museum for Israel's armored corps is the Yad La-Shiryon in Latrun,\nwhich houses one of the largest tank museums in the world. Other significant\nmilitary museums are the Israel Defense Forces History Museum (Batei Ha-Osef)\nin Tel Aviv, the Palmach Museum, and the Beit HaTotchan of artillery in\nZikhron Ya'akov. The Israeli Air Force Museum is located at Hatzerim Airbase\nin the Negev Desert, and the Israeli Clandestine Immigration and Naval Museum,\nis in Haifa.\n\nIsrael's National Military Cemetery is at Mount Herzl. Other Israeli military\ncemeteries include Kiryat Shaul Military Cemetery in Tel Aviv, and Sgula\nmilitary cemetery at Petah Tikva.\n\n### Parades[edit]\n\nSee also: Yom Ha'atzmaut and Israel Defense Forces parade\n\nIsrael Defense Forces parades took place on Independence Day, during the first\n25 years of the State of Israel's existence. They were cancelled after 1973\ndue to financial and security concerns. The Israel Defense Forces still has\nweapon exhibitions country-wide on Independence Day, but they are stationary.\n\n## Foreign military relations[edit]\n\n### France[edit]\n\nStarting on the Independence day on 14 May 1948 (5 Iyar 5708), a strong\nmilitary, commercial and political relationship were established between\nFrance and Israel until 1969. The highest level of the military collaboration\nwas reached between 1956 and 1966.[94] At this time France provided almost all\nthe aircraft, tanks and military ships. In 1969 the French president Charles\nde Gaulle limited the export of weapons to Israel. This was the end of the\n\"golden age\" 20 years of relations between Israel and France.\n\n### United States[edit]\n\nMain article: Israel \u2013 United States military relations\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Gen._Martin_E._Dempsey\n_meets_with_Lt._Gen._Benny_Gantz.jpg/220px-\nGen._Martin_E._Dempsey_meets_with_Lt._Gen._Benny_Gantz.jpg)\n\nFormer IDF Chief of Staff Benny Gantz (right) meets with Martin Dempsey\n(left), Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/US_Navy_050415-M\n-9114Y-008_Marines_assigned_to_the_26th_Marine_Expeditionary_Unit_%28special_o\nperations_capable%29_along_Israeli_Defense_Force_soldiers_fast_rope_from_a_CH-\n46E_Sea_Knight_helicopter.jpg/220px-thumbnail.jpg)\n\nIsraeli soldiers training alongside the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit on the\nUSS _Kearsarge_\n\nIn 1983, the United States and Israel established a Joint Political Military\nGroup, which convenes twice a year. Both the U.S. and Israel participate in\njoint military planning and combined exercises, and have collaborated on\nmilitary research and weapons development. Additionally the U.S. military\nmaintains two classified, pre-positioned War Reserve Stocks in Israel valued\nat $493 million.[95] Israel has the official distinction of being an American\nMajor non-NATO ally. As a result of this, the US and Israel share the vast\nmajority[_citation needed_] of their security and military technology.\n\nSince 1976, Israel had been the largest annual recipient of U.S. foreign\nassistance. In 2009, Israel received $2.55 billion in Foreign Military\nFinancing (FMF) grants from the Department of Defense.[96] All but 26% of this\nmilitary aid is for the purchase of military hardware from American companies\nonly.[96]\n\nThe United States has an anti-missile system base in the Negev region of\nSouthern Israel, which is manned by 120 US Army personnel.[_citation needed_]\n\nIn October 2012, United States and Israel began their biggest joint air and\nmissile defense exercise, known as Austere Challenge 12, involving around\n3,500 U.S. troops in the region along with 1,000 IDF personnel.[97] Germany\nand Britain also participated.[98]\n\n### India[edit]\n\nFurther information: India\u2013Israel relations\n\nIndia and Israel enjoy strong military and strategic ties.[99] Israeli\nauthorities consider Indian citizens to be the most pro-Israel people in the\nworld.[100][101][102][103][104][105] Apart from being Israel's second-largest\neconomic partner in Asia,[106] India is also the largest customer of Israeli\narms in the world.[107] In 2006, annual military sales between India and\nIsrael stood at US$900 million.[108] Israeli defense firms had the largest\nexhibition at the 2009 Aero India show, during which Israel offered several\nstate-of-the art weapons to India.[109] The first major military deal between\nthe two countries was the sale of Israeli EL/W-2090 AEW radars to the Indian\nAir Force in 2004.[110] In March 2009, India and Israel signed a US$1.4\nbillion deal under which Israel would sell India an advanced air-defense\nsystem.[111] India and Israel have also embarked on extensive space\ncooperation. In 2008, India's ISRO launched Israel's most technologically\nadvanced spy satellite TecSAR.[112] In 2009, India reportedly developed a\nhigh-tech spy satellite RISAT-2 with significant assistance from Israel.[113]\nThe satellite was successfully launched by India in April 2009.[114]\n\nAccording to a Los Angeles Times news story the 2008 Mumbai attacks were an\nattack on the growing India-Israel partnership. It quotes retired Indian Vice\nAdmiral Premvir S. Das thus \"Their aim was to... tell the Indians clearly that\nyour growing linkage with Israel is not what you should be doing...\"[115] In\nthe past, India and Israel have held numerous joint anti-terror training\nexercises[116]\n\n### Germany[edit]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/I.n.s._dolfin-03.JPG/2\n20px-I.n.s._dolfin-03.JPG)\n\nA German-made Dolphin class submarine\n\nFurther information: Germany\u2013Israel relations\n\nGermany developed the Dolphin submarine and supplied it to Israel. Two\nsubmarines were donated by Germany.[117] The military co-operation has been\ndiscreet but mutually profitable: Israeli intelligence, for example, sent\ncaptured Warsaw Pact armour to West Germany to be analysed. The results aided\nthe German development of an anti-tank system.[118] Israel also trained\nmembers of GSG 9, a German counter-terrorism and special operations unit.[119]\nThe Israeli Merkava MK IV tank uses a German V12 engine produced under\nlicense.[120]\n\nIn 2008, the website DefenseNews revealed that Germany and Israel had been\njointly developing a nuclear warning system, dubbed Operation\nBluebird.[121][122]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Israeli_Sea_Corps_Sold\niers.jpg/220px-Israeli_Sea_Corps_Soldiers.jpg)\n\nSailors of the Israeli Navy\n\n### United Kingdom[edit]\n\nFurther information: Israel \u2013 United Kingdom relations\n\nDuring a secret operation in 1966, two British made \"Chieftain\" MBTs were\nbrought to Israel for a 4 years long evaluation for service with the IDF. The\nplan was for the IDF not only to purchase the British MBTs, but for IMI\n(Israeli Military Industries) to buy production rights. As part of the deal\nduring the early 60's Israel purchased second hand \"Centurion\" MBTs from the\nBritish, that used that money in the \"Chieftain\" development. After the trials\nwere done Israeli improvement and ideas were implemented by the British\nmanufacturer, but British politicians cancelled the agreement with Israel and\nthe program was shut down. The knowledge earned during the improvements on the\n\"Chieftain\", together with earlier experiments in tank improvements, gave the\nlast push for the development and production of the \"Merkava\" tank.\n\nUnited Kingdom has supplied equipment and spare parts for Sa'ar 4.5-class\nmissile boats and F-4 Phantom fighter-bombers, components for small-caliber\nartillery ammunition and air-to-surface missiles, and engines for Elbit Hermes\n450 Unmanned aerial vehicles. British arms sales to Israel mainly consist of\nlight weaponry, and ammunition and components for helicopters, tanks, armored\npersonnel carriers, and combat aircraft.[123][124]\n\n### China[edit]\n\nFurther information: People's Republic of China \u2013 Israel relations\n\nIsrael is the second-largest foreign supplier of arms to the People's Republic\nof China, only after the Russian Federation. China has purchased a wide array\nof military hardware from Israel, including Unmanned aerial vehicles and\ncommunications satellites. China has become an extensive market for Israel's\nmilitary industries and arms manufacturers, and trade with Israel has allowed\nit to obtain \"dual-use\" technology which the United States and European Union\nwere reluctant to provide.[125] In 2010 Yair Golan, head of IDF Home Front\nCommand visited China to strengthen military ties.[126] In 2012, IDF Chief of\nStaff Benny Gantz visited China for high-level talks with the Chinese defense\nestablishment.[127]\n\n### Cyprus[edit]\n\nFurther information: Cyprus-Israel relations\n\nAs closely neighboring countries, Israel and Cyprus have enjoyed greatly\nimproving diplomatic relations since 2010. During the Mount Carmel Forest\nFire, Cyprus dispatched two aviation assets to assist fire-fighting operations\nin Israel \u2013 the first time Cypriot Government aircraft were permitted to\noperate from Israeli airfields in a non-civil capacity.[128] In addition,\nIsrael and Cyprus have closely cooperated in maritime activities relating to\nGaza, since 2010, and have reportedly begun an extensive sharing program of\nregional intelligence to support mutual security concerns. On 17 May 2012, it\nwas widely reported that the Israeli Air Force had been granted unrestricted\naccess to the Nicosia Flight Information Region of Cyprus, and that Israeli\naviation assets may have operated over the island itself.[129] Cyprus, as a\nformer S-300 air-defense system operator, was speculated by Greek media to\nhave assisted Israel in strategic planning to challenge such air-defense\nsystems, alongside shorter-range SAM systems, although this remains\nunconfirmed.\n\n### Greece[edit]\n\nFurther information: Greece-Israel relations\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Flickr_-\n_Israel_Defense_Forces_-_To_the_Olympic.jpg/220px-Flickr_-\n_Israel_Defense_Forces_-_To_the_Olympic.jpg)\n\nThree IAF helicopters, two Apache longbows and one Black Hawk, fly above Greek\nmountains during a joint exercise with the Hellenic Air Force, June 2011\n\nIsrael and Greece have enjoyed a very cordial military relationship since\n2008, including military drills ranging from Israel to the island of Crete.\nDrills include air-to-air long-distance refueling, long-range flights, and\nmost importantly aiding Israel in outmaneuvering the S-300 which Greece\nhas.[130] Recent purchases include 100 million euro deal between Greece and\nIsrael for the purchase of SPICE 1000 and SPICE 2000 pound bomb kits. They\nhave also signed many defense agreements, including Cyprus, in order to\nestablish stability for transporting gas from Israel-Cyprus to Greece and on\nto the European Union-a paramount objective to the future stability and\nprosperity of all three countries, threatened by Turkey.\n\n### Turkey[edit]\n\nFurther information: Israel\u2013Turkey relations\n\nIsrael has provided extensive military assistance to Turkey. Israel sold\nTurkey IAI Heron Unmanned aerial vehicles, and modernized Turkey's F-4 Phantom\nand Northrop F-5 aircraft at the cost of $900 million. Turkey's main battle\ntank is the Israeli-made Sabra tank, of which Turkey has 170. Israel later\nupgraded them for $500 million. Israel has also supplied Turkey with Israeli-\nmade missiles, and the two nations have engaged in naval cooperation. Turkey\nallowed Israeli pilots to practice long-range flying over mountainous terrain\nin Turkey's Konya firing range, while Israel trains Turkish pilots at Israel's\ncomputerized firing range at Nevatim Airbase.[131][132] Until 2009, the\nTurkish military was one of Israel's largest defense customers. Israel defense\ncompanies have sold unmanned aerial vehicles and long-range targeting\npods.[133]\n\nHowever, relations have been strained in recent times. In the last two years,\nthe Turkish military has declined to participate in the annual joint naval\nexercise with Israel and the United States. The exercise, known as \"Reliant\nMermaid\" was started in 1998 and included the Israeli, Turkish and American\nnavies.[134] The objective of the exercise is to practice search-and-rescue\noperations and to familiarize each navy with international partners who also\noperate in the Mediterranean Sea.[135]\n\n### Azerbaijan[edit]\n\nFurther information: Azerbaijan\u2013Israel relations\n\nAzerbaijan and Israel have engaged in intense cooperation since 1992.[136]\nIsraeli military have been a major provider of battlefield aviation,\nartillery, antitank, and anti-infantry weaponry to Azerbaijan.[137][138] In\n2009, Israeli President Shimon Peres made a visit to Azerbaijan where military\nrelations were expanded further, with the Israeli company Aeronautics Defense\nSystems Ltd announcing it was going to build a factory in Baku.[139] In 2012,\nIsrael and Azerbaijan signed an agreement according to which state-run Israel\nAerospace Industries would sell $1.6 billion in drones and anti-aircraft and\nmissile defense systems to Azerbaijan.[140] In March 2012, the magazine\n_Foreign Policy_ reported that the Israeli Air Force may be preparing to use\nthe Sitalchay Military Airbase, located 500\u00a0km (310\u00a0mi) from the Iranian\nborder, for air strikes against the nuclear program of Iran,[141] later backed\nup by other media.[142]\n\n### Other countries[edit]\n\nIsrael has also sold or received supplies of military equipment from the Czech\nRepublic, Spain, Slovakia, Italy, South Africa, Canada, Australia, Poland,\nSlovenia, Romania, Hungary, Belgium, Austria, Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and\nHerzegovina,[143] Georgia,[144][145] Vietnam and Colombia,[146] among others.\n\n## Future[edit]\n\nSee also: Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II Israeli procurement\n\nThe IDF is planning a number of technological upgrades and structural reforms\nfor the future for its land, air, and sea branches. Training has been\nincreased, including in cooperation between ground, air, and naval units.[147]\n\nThe Israeli Army is phasing out the M-16 rifle from all ground units in favor\nof the IMI Tavor.[148] In addition, the IDF is now replacing its outdated M113\narmored personnel carriers in favor of new Namer APCs, with 200 ordered in\n2014, and is upgrading its IDF Achzarit APCs.[149][150] The IDF also announced\nplans to streamline its military bureaucracy so as to better maintain its\nreserve force, which a 2014 State Comptroller report noted was under-trained\nand may not be able to fulfill wartime missions. As part of the plans, 100,000\nreservists and will be discharged, and training for the remainder will be\nimproved. The officer corps will be slashed by 5,000. In addition, infantry\nand light artillery brigades will be reduced to increase training standards\namong the rest.[151] The backbone of the IDF Artillery Corps, the M109\nhowitzer, will be phased out in favor of a still-undecided replacement, with\nthe ATMOS 2000 and Artillery Gun Module under primary consideration.[152] The\nIDF is also planning a future tank to replace the Merkava. The new tank will\nbe able to fire lasers and electromagnetic pulses, run on a hybrid engine, run\nwith a crew as small as two, will be faster, and will be better-protected,\nwith emphasis on protection systems such as the Trophy over armor.[153][154]\n\nThe Israeli Air Force will purchase as many as 100 F-35 Lightning II fighter\njets from the United States. The aircraft will be modified and designated\nF-35I. They will use Israeli-built electronic warfare systems, outer-wings,\nguided bombs, and air-to-air missiles.[155][156][157] As part of a 2013 arms\ndeal, the IAF will purchase KC-135 Stratotanker aerial refueling aircraft and\nV-22 Osprey multi-mission aircraft from the United States, as well as advanced\nradars for warplanes and missiles designed to take out radars.[158] In April\n2013, an Israeli official stated that within 40\u201350 years, piloted aircraft\nwould be phased out of service by unmanned aerial vehicles capable of\nexecuting nearly any operation that can be performed by piloted combat\naircraft. Israel's military industries are reportedly on the path to\ndeveloping such technology in a few decades. Israel will also manufacture\ntactical satellites for military use.[159]\n\nThe Israeli Navy is currently expanding its submarine fleet, with a planned\ntotal of six Dolphin class submarines. Currently, five have been delivered,\nwith the sixth expected in 2017. It is also upgrading and expanding its\nsurface fleet. It is planning to upgrade the electronic warfare systems of its\nSa'ar 5-class corvettes and Sa'ar 4.5 class missile boats,[160] and has\nordered two new classes of warship: the Sa'ar 6-class corvette (a variant of\nthe Braunschweig-class corvette) and the Sa'ar 72-class corvette (an improved\nand enlarged version of the Sa'ar 4.5-class). It plans to acquire four Saar\n6-class corvettes and three Sa'ar 72-class corvettes. Israel is also\ndeveloping marine artillery, including a gun capable of firing satellite-\nguided 155mm rounds between 75 and 120 kilometers.[161][162]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n![Portal\nicon](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Flag_of_Israel.svg\n/32px-Flag_of_Israel.svg.png) | Israel portal  \n---|---  \n![Portal\nicon](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Bluetank.png/32px-\nBluetank.png) | War portal  \n  \n  * Arab\u2013Israeli conflict\n  * Defense industry of Israel\n  * Israel and weapons of mass destruction\n  * Israeli casualties of war\n  * Israeli security forces\n  * Israel Defense Forces ranks\n  * Israeli wars\n  * Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict\n  * List of brigades of the Israel Defense Forces\n  * Krav Maga\n  * Military equipment of Israel\n  * Military history of Israel\n  * Military operations conducted by the Israel Defense Forces\n  * Palestinian political violence\n  * Refusal to serve in the Israeli military\n\n## References and footnotes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ _**a**_ _**b**_ \"The Institute for National Security Studies\", chapter Israel, 2012 8 May 2012.\n  2. **^** _The Military Balance 2014_, International Institute for Strategic Studies, February 5, 2014, pp.\u00a0323\u2013326\u00a0\n  3. **^** \"Military expenditure (% of GDP)\".

It involved the vast majority of the world's nations\u2014including all of the great powers\u2014eventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \"total war\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed)[1][2] and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki),[3] it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War\u00a0II the deadliest conflict in human history.[4]\n\nThe Empire of Japan aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific and was already at\nwar with the Republic of China in 1937,[5] but the world war is generally said\nto have begun on 1 September 1939[6] with the invasion of Poland by Germany\nand subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United\nKingdom. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and treaties,\nGermany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe, and formed the\nAxis alliance with Italy and Japan. Under the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact of\nAugust 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories\nof their European neighbours, Poland, Finland, Romania and the Baltic states.\nThe war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the coalition\nof the United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth, with campaigns including\nthe North Africa and East Africa campaigns, the aerial Battle of Britain, the\nBlitz bombing campaign, the Balkan Campaign as well as the long-running Battle\nof the Atlantic. In June 1941, the European Axis powers launched an invasion\nof the Soviet Union, opening the largest land theatre of war in history, which\ntrapped the major part of the Axis' military forces into a war of attrition.\nIn December 1941, Japan attacked the United States and European territories in\nthe Pacific Ocean, and quickly conquered much of the Western Pacific.\n\nThe Axis advance halted in 1942 when Japan lost the critical Battle of Midway,\nnear Hawaii, and Germany was defeated in North Africa and then, decisively, at\nStalingrad in the Soviet Union. In 1943, with a series of German defeats on\nthe Eastern Front, the Allied invasion of Sicily and the Allied invasion of\nItaly which brought about Italian surrender, and Allied victories in the\nPacific, the Axis lost the initiative and undertook strategic retreat on all\nfronts. In 1944, the Western Allies invaded German-occupied France, while the\nSoviet Union regained all of its territorial losses and invaded Germany and\nits allies. During 1944 and 1945 the Japanese suffered major reverses in\nmainland Asia in South Central China and Burma, while the Allies crippled the\nJapanese Navy and captured key Western Pacific islands.\n\nThe war in Europe concluded with an invasion of Germany by the Western Allies\nand the Soviet Union, culminating in the capture of Berlin by Soviet and\nPolish troops and the subsequent German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945.\nFollowing the Potsdam Declaration by the Allies on 26 July 1945 and the\nrefusal of Japan to surrender under its terms, the United States dropped\natomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 August and\n9 August respectively. With an invasion of the Japanese archipelago imminent,\nthe possibility of additional atomic bombings, and the Soviet Union's\ndeclaration of war on Japan and invasion of Manchuria, Japan surrendered on 15\nAugust 1945. Thus ended the war in Asia, cementing the total victory of the\nAllies.\n\nWorld War\u00a0II altered the political alignment and social structure of the\nworld. The United Nations (UN) was established to foster international co-\noperation and prevent future conflicts. The victorious great powers\u2014the United\nStates, the Soviet Union, China, the United Kingdom, and France\u2014became the\npermanent members of the United Nations Security Council.[7] The Soviet Union\nand the United States emerged as rival superpowers, setting the stage for the\nCold War, which lasted for the next 46 years. Meanwhile, the influence of\nEuropean great powers waned, while the decolonisation of Asia and Africa\nbegan. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic\nrecovery. Political integration, especially in Europe, emerged as an effort to\nend pre-war enmities and to create a common identity.[8]\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Chronology\n  * 2 Background\n    * 2.1 Europe\n    * 2.2 Asia\n  * 3 Pre-war events\n    * 3.1 Italian invasion of Ethiopia (1935)\n    * 3.2 Spanish Civil War (1936\u201339)\n    * 3.3 Japanese invasion of China (1937)\n    * 3.4 Soviet-Japanese border conflicts\n    * 3.5 European occupations and agreements\n  * 4 Course of the war\n    * 4.1 War breaks out in Europe (1939\u201340)\n    * 4.2 Western Europe (1940\u201341)\n    * 4.3 Mediterranean (1940\u201341)\n    * 4.4 Axis attack on the USSR (1941)\n    * 4.5 War breaks out in the Pacific (1941)\n    * 4.6 Axis advance stalls (1942\u201343)\n      * 4.6.1 Pacific (1942\u201343)\n      * 4.6.2 Eastern Front (1942\u201343)\n      * 4.6.3 Western Europe/Atlantic &amp; Mediterranean (1942\u201343)\n    * 4.7 Allies gain momentum (1943\u201344)\n    * 4.8 Allies close in (1944)\n    * 4.9 Axis collapse, Allied victory (1944\u201345)\n  * 5 Aftermath\n  * 6 Impact\n    * 6.1 Casualties and war crimes\n    * 6.2 Concentration camps, slave labour, and genocide\n    * 6.3 Occupation\n    * 6.4 Home fronts and production\n    * 6.5 Advances in technology and warfare\n  * 7 See also\n  * 8 Notes\n  * 9 Citations\n  * 10 References\n  * 11 External links\n\n## Chronology\n\nSee also: Timeline of World War II\n\nThe start of the war in Europe is generally held to be 1 September\n1939,[9][10] beginning with the German invasion of Poland; Britain and France\ndeclared war on Germany two days later. The dates for the beginning of war in\nthe Pacific include the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War on 7 July\n1937,[11] or even the Japanese invasion of Manchuria on 19 September\n1931.[12][13]\n\nOthers follow the British historian A. J. P. Taylor, who held that the Sino-\nJapanese War and war in Europe and its colonies occurred simultaneously and\nthe two wars merged in 1941. This article uses the conventional dating. Other\nstarting dates sometimes used for World War\u00a0II include the Italian invasion of\nAbyssinia on 3 October 1935.[14] The British historian Antony Beevor views the\nbeginning of the Second World War as the Battles of Khalkhin Gol fought\nbetween Japan and the forces of Mongolia and the Soviet Union from May to\nSeptember 1939.[15]\n\nThe exact date of the war's end is also not universally agreed upon. It was\ngenerally accepted at the time that the war ended with the armistice of 14\nAugust 1945 (V-J Day), rather than the formal surrender of Japan (2 September\n1945). A peace treaty with Japan was signed in 1951 to formally tie up any\nloose ends such as compensation to be paid to Allied prisoners of war who had\nbeen victims of atrocities.[16] A treaty regarding Germany's future allowed\nthe reunification of East and West Germany to take place in 1990 and resolved\nother post-World War II issues.[17]\n\n## Background\n\nMain article: Causes of World War II\n\n### Europe\n\nWorld War I had radically altered the political European map, with the defeat\nof the Central Powers\u2014including Austria-Hungary, Germany and the Ottoman\nEmpire\u2014and the 1917 Bolshevik seizure of power in Russia, which eventually led\nto the founding of the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, the victorious Allies of World\nWar I, such as France, Belgium, Italy, Greece and Romania, gained territory,\nand new nation-states were created out of the collapse of Austria-Hungary and\nthe Ottoman and Russian Empires.\n\nTo prevent a future world war, the League of Nations was created during the\n1919 Paris Peace Conference. The organisation's primary goals were to prevent\narmed conflict through collective security, military and naval disarmament,\nand settling international disputes through peaceful negotiations and\narbitration.\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Bundesarchiv_Bild_102-\n09042%2C_Genf%2C_V%C3%B6lkerbund%2C_Sitzungssaal.jpg/220px-\nBundesarchiv_Bild_102-09042%2C_Genf%2C_V%C3%B6lkerbund%2C_Sitzungssaal.jpg)\n\nThe League of Nations assembly, held in Geneva, Switzerland, 1930\n\nDespite strong pacifist sentiment after World War I,[18] its aftermath still\ncaused irredentist and revanchist nationalism in several European states.\nThese sentiments were especially marked in Germany because of the significant\nterritorial, colonial, and financial losses incurred by the Treaty of\nVersailles. Under the treaty, Germany lost around 13 percent of its home\nterritory and all of its overseas colonies, while German annexation of other\nstates was prohibited, reparations were imposed, and limits were placed on the\nsize and capability of the country's armed forces.[19]\n\nThe German Empire was dissolved in the German Revolution of 1918\u20131919, and a\ndemocratic government, later known as the Weimar Republic, was created. The\ninterwar period saw strife between supporters of the new republic and hardline\nopponents on both the right and left. Italy, as an Entente ally, had made some\npost-war territorial gains; however, Italian nationalists were angered that\nthe promises made by Britain and France to secure Italian entrance into the\nwar were not fulfilled with the peace settlement. From 1922 to 1925, the\nFascist movement led by Benito Mussolini seized power in Italy with a\nnationalist, totalitarian, and class collaborationist agenda that abolished\nrepresentative democracy, repressed socialist, left-wing and liberal forces,\nand pursued an aggressive expansionist foreign policy aimed at making Italy a\nworld power, promising the creation of a \"New Roman Empire\".[20]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Bundesarchiv_Bild_102-\n10541%2C_Weimar%2C_Aufmarsch_der_Nationalsozialisten.jpg/220px-Bundesarchiv_Bi\nld_102-10541%2C_Weimar%2C_Aufmarsch_der_Nationalsozialisten.jpg)\n\nAdolf Hitler at a German National Socialist political rally in Weimar, October\n1930\n\nAdolf Hitler, after an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the German government\nin 1923, eventually became the Chancellor of Germany in 1933. He abolished\ndemocracy, espousing a radical, racially motivated revision of the world\norder, and soon began a massive rearmament campaign.[21] It was at this time\nthat political scientists began to predict that a second Great War might take\nplace.[22] Meanwhile, France, to secure its alliance, allowed Italy a free\nhand in Ethiopia, which Italy desired as a colonial possession. The situation\nwas aggravated in early 1935 when the Territory of the Saar Basin was legally\nreunited with Germany and Hitler repudiated the Treaty of Versailles,\naccelerated his rearmament programme, and introduced conscription.[23]\n\nHoping to contain Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Italy formed the\nStresa Front; however, in June 1935, the United Kingdom made an independent\nnaval agreement with Germany, easing prior restrictions. The Soviet Union,\nconcerned by Germany's goals of capturing vast areas of eastern Europe,\ndrafted a treaty of mutual assistance with France. Before taking effect\nthough, the Franco-Soviet pact was required to go through the bureaucracy of\nthe League of Nations, which rendered it essentially toothless.[24] The United\nStates, concerned with events in Europe and Asia, passed the Neutrality Act in\nAugust of the same year.[25]\n\nHitler defied the Versailles and Locarno treaties by remilitarising the\nRhineland in March 1936. He encountered little opposition from other European\npowers.[26] In October 1936, Germany and Italy formed the Rome\u2013Berlin Axis. A\nmonth later, Germany and Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact, which Italy\nwould join in the following year.\n\n### Asia\n\nThe Kuomintang (KMT) party in China launched a unification campaign against\nregional warlords and nominally unified China in the mid-1920s, but was soon\nembroiled in a civil war against its former Chinese communist allies.[27] In\n1931, an increasingly militaristic Japanese Empire, which had long sought\ninfluence in China[28] as the first step of what its government saw as the\ncountry's right to rule Asia, used the Mukden Incident as a pretext to launch\nan invasion of Manchuria and establish the puppet state of Manchukuo.[29]\n\nToo weak to resist Japan, China appealed to the League of Nations for help.\nJapan withdrew from the League of Nations after being condemned for its\nincursion into Manchuria. The two nations then fought several battles, in\nShanghai, Rehe and Hebei, until the Tanggu Truce was signed in 1933.\nThereafter, Chinese volunteer forces continued the resistance to Japanese\naggression in Manchuria, and Chahar and Suiyuan.[30] After the 1936 Xi'an\nIncident, the Kuomintang and communist forces agreed on a ceasefire to present\na united front to oppose Japan.[31]\n\n## Pre-war events\n\n### Italian invasion of Ethiopia (1935)\n\nMain article: Second Italo-Abyssinian War\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Soldatietiopia.jpg\n/220px-Soldatietiopia.jpg)\n\nItalian soldiers recruited in 1935, on their way to fight the Second Italo-\nAbyssinian War\n\nThe Second Italo\u2013Abyssinian War was a brief colonial war that began in October\n1935 and ended in May 1936. The war began with the invasion of the Ethiopian\nEmpire (also known as Abyssinia) by the armed forces of the Kingdom of Italy\n(_Regno d'Italia_), which was launched from Italian Somaliland and\nEritrea.[32] The war resulted in the military occupation of Ethiopia and its\nannexation into the newly created colony of Italian East Africa (_Africa\nOrientale Italiana_, or AOI); in addition, it exposed the weakness of the\nLeague of Nations as a force to preserve peace. Both Italy and Ethiopia were\nmember nations, but the League did nothing when the former clearly violated\nthe League's own Article X.[33] Germany was the only major European nation to\nsupport the invasion. Italy subsequently dropped its objections to Germany's\ngoal of absorbing Austria.[34]\n\n### Spanish Civil War (1936\u201339)\n\nMain article: Spanish Civil War\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-\nH25224%2C_Guernica%2C_Ruinen.jpg/220px-\nBundesarchiv_Bild_183-H25224%2C_Guernica%2C_Ruinen.jpg)\n\nThe bombing of Guernica in 1937, sparked Europe-wide fears that the next war\nwould be based on bombing of cities with very high civilian casualties\n\nWhen civil war broke out in Spain, Hitler and Mussolini lent military support\nto the Nationalist rebels, led by General Francisco Franco. The Soviet Union\nsupported the existing government, the Spanish Republic. Over 30,000 foreign\nvolunteers, known as the International Brigades, also fought against the\nNationalists. Both Germany and the USSR used this proxy war as an opportunity\nto test in combat their most advanced weapons and tactics. The bombing of\nGuernica by the German Condor Legion in April 1937 heightened widespread\nconcerns that the next major war would include extensive terror bombing\nattacks on civilians.[35][36] The Nationalists won the civil war in April\n1939; Franco, now dictator, bargained with both sides during the Second World\nWar, but never concluded any major agreements. He did send volunteers to fight\non the Eastern Front under German command but Spain remained neutral and did\nnot allow either side to use its territory.[37]\n\n### Japanese invasion of China (1937)\n\nMain article: Second Sino-Japanese War\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Shanghai1937IJA_ruins.\njpg/220px-Shanghai1937IJA_ruins.jpg)\n\nJapanese Imperial Army soldiers during the Battle of Shanghai, 1937\n\nIn July 1937, Japan captured the former Chinese imperial capital of Beijing\nafter instigating the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, which culminated in the\nJapanese campaign to invade all of China.[38] The Soviets quickly signed a\nnon-aggression pact with China to lend materiel support, effectively ending\nChina's prior co-operation with Germany. Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek\ndeployed his best army to defend Shanghai, but, after three months of\nfighting, Shanghai fell. The Japanese continued to push the Chinese forces\nback, capturing the capital Nanking in December 1937. After the fall of\nNanking, tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians\nand disarmed combatants were murdered by the Japanese.[39][40]\n\nIn March 1938, Nationalist Chinese forces won their first major victory at\nTaierzhuang but then the city of Xuzhou was taken by Japanese in May.[41] In\nJune 1938, Chinese forces stalled the Japanese advance by flooding the Yellow\nRiver; this manoeuvre bought time for the Chinese to prepare their defences at\nWuhan, but the city was taken by October.[42] Japanese military victories did\nnot bring about the collapse of Chinese resistance that Japan had hoped to\nachieve; instead the Chinese government relocated inland to Chongqing and\ncontinued the war.[43][44]\n\n### Soviet-Japanese border conflicts\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Battle_of_Lake_Khasan-\nRed_Army_gunners_in_the_interval.jpg/200px-Battle_of_Lake_Khasan-\nRed_Army_gunners_in_the_interval.jpg)\n\nRed Army artillery unit during the Battle of Lake Khasan, 1938\n\nMain article: Soviet\u2013Japanese border conflicts\n\nJapanese forces in Manchukuo had sporadic border clashes with the Soviet Union\nand Mongolia.

With\nthe devastating Japanese defeat at Khalkin Gol in 1939 and ally Nazi Germany\npursuing neutrality with the Soviets, this policy would prove difficult to\nmaintain. Japan and the Soviet Union eventually signed a Neutrality Pact in\nApril 1941, and Japan adopted the doctrine of Nanshin-ron, which took its\nfocus southward, eventually leading to its war with the United States and the\nWestern Allies.[45][46]\n\n### European occupations and agreements\n\nFurther information: Anschluss, Appeasement, Munich Agreement, German\noccupation of Czechoslovakia and Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-\nR69173%2C_M%C3%BCnchener_Abkommen%2C_Staatschefs.jpg/220px-\nBundesarchiv_Bild_183-R69173%2C_M%C3%BCnchener_Abkommen%2C_Staatschefs.jpg)\n\nChamberlain, Daladier, Hitler, Mussolini, and Ciano pictured just before\nsigning the Munich Agreement, 29 September 1938\n\nIn Europe, Germany and Italy were becoming more aggressive. In March 1938,\nGermany annexed Austria, again provoking little response from other European\npowers.[47] Encouraged, Hitler began pressing German claims on the\nSudetenland, an area of Czechoslovakia with a predominantly ethnic German\npopulation; and soon Britain and France followed the counsel of British Prime\nMinister Neville Chamberlain and conceded this territory to Germany in the\nMunich Agreement, which was made against the wishes of the Czechoslovak\ngovernment, in exchange for a promise of no further territorial demands.[48]\nSoon afterwards, Germany and Italy forced Czechoslovakia to cede additional\nterritory to Hungary and Poland.[49]\n\nAlthough all of Germany's stated demands had been satisfied by the agreement,\nprivately Hitler was furious that British interference had prevented him from\nseizing all of Czechoslovakia in one operation. In subsequent speeches Hitler\nattacked British and Jewish \"war-mongers\" and in January 1939 secretly ordered\na major build-up of the German navy to challenge British naval supremacy. In\nMarch 1939, Germany invaded the remainder of Czechoslovakia and subsequently\nsplit it into the German Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and a pro-German\nclient state, the Slovak Republic.[50] Hitler also delivered an ultimatum to\nLithuania, forcing the concession of the Klaip\u0117da Region.\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-\nS52480%2C_Dtsch.-Sowjet._Grenz-_u._Freundschaftsvertrag.jpg/220px-\nBundesarchiv_Bild_183-S52480%2C_Dtsch.-Sowjet._Grenz-\n_u._Freundschaftsvertrag.jpg)\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Ribbentrop signing the Nazi\u2013Soviet non-aggression\npact.

The parties gave\neach other rights to \"spheres of influence\" (western Poland and Lithuania for\nGermany; eastern Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Bessarabia for the\nUSSR). It also raised the question of continuing Polish independence.[54] The\nagreement was crucial to Hitler because it assured that Germany would not have\nto face the prospect of a two-front war, as it had in World War I, after it\ndefeated Poland.\n\nThe situation reached a general crisis in late August as German troops\ncontinued to mobilise against the Polish border. In a private meeting with the\nItalian foreign minister, Count Ciano, Hitler asserted that Poland was a\n\"doubtful neutral\" that needed to either yield to his demands or be\n\"liquidated\" to prevent it from drawing off German troops in the future\n\"unavoidable\" war with the Western democracies. He did not believe Britain or\nFrance would intervene in the conflict.[55] On 23 August Hitler ordered the\nattack to proceed on 26 August, but upon hearing that Britain had concluded a\nformal mutual assistance pact with Poland and that Italy would maintain\nneutrality, he decided to delay it.[56] In response to British demands for\ndirect negotiations, Germany demanded on 29 August that a Polish\nplenipotentiary immediately travel to Berlin to negotiate the handover of\nDanzig and the Polish Corridor to Germany as well as to agree to safeguard the\nGerman minority in Poland. The Poles refused to comply with this request and\non the night of 30\u201331 August in a violent interview with Neville Henderson,\nRibbentrop declared that Germany considered its proposals rejected.[57]\n\n## Course of the war\n\nFurther information: Diplomatic history of World War II\n\n### War breaks out in Europe (1939\u201340)\n\nMain articles: Invasion of Poland, Occupation of Poland (1939\u201345), Nazi crimes\nagainst the Polish nation, Soviet invasion of Poland and Soviet repressions of\nPolish citizens (1939\u201346)\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Granica-\nzrywanie_god%C5%82a.jpg/220px-Granica-zrywanie_god%C5%82a.jpg)\n\nSoldiers of the German Wehrmacht tearing down the border crossing between\nPoland and the Free City of Danzig, 1 September 1939\n\nOn 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland under the false pretext that the\nPoles had carried out a series of sabotage operations against German\ntargets.[58] Two days later, on 3 September, after a British ultimatum to\nGermany to cease military operations was ignored, France and the United\nKingdom, followed by the fully independent Dominions[59] of the British\nCommonwealth[60]\u2014Australia (3 September), Canada (10 September), New Zealand\n(3 September), and South Africa (6 September)\u2014declared war on Germany.\nHowever, initially the alliance provided limited direct military support to\nPoland, consisting of a cautious, half-hearted French probe into the\nSaarland.[61] The Western Allies also began a naval blockade of Germany, which\naimed to damage the country's economy and war effort.[62] Germany responded by\nordering U-boat warfare against Allied merchant and warships, which was to\nlater escalate into the Battle of the Atlantic.\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Bundesarchiv_Bild_146-\n1976-071-36%2C_Polen%2C_an_der_Brahe%2C_deutsche_Panzer.jpg/220px-Bundesarchiv\n_Bild_146-1976-071-36%2C_Polen%2C_an_der_Brahe%2C_deutsche_Panzer.jpg)\n\nGerman Panzer I tanks near the city of Bydgoszcz, during the Invasion of\nPoland, September 1939\n\nOn 17 September 1939, after signing a cease-fire with Japan, the Soviets\ninvaded Poland from the east.[63] The Polish army was defeated and Warsaw\nsurrendered to the Germans on 27 September, with final pockets of resistance\nsurrendering on 6 October.

The Netherlands and Belgium were overrun using\nblitzkrieg tactics in a few days and weeks, respectively.[86] The French-\nfortified Maginot Line and the main body the Allied forces which had moved\ninto Belgium were circumvented by a flanking movement through the thickly\nwooded Ardennes region,[87] mistakenly perceived by Allied planners as an\nimpenetrable natural barrier against armoured vehicles.[88][89] As a result,\nthe bulk of the Allied armies found themselves trapped in an encirclement and\nwere beaten. The majority were taken prisoner, whilst over 300,000, mostly\nBritish and French, were evacuated from the continent at Dunkirk by early\nJune, although abandoning almost all of their equipment.[90]\n\nOn 10 June, Italy invaded France, declaring war on both France and the United\nKingdom.[91] Paris fell to the Germans on 14 June and eight days later France\nsigned an armistice with Germany and was soon divided into German and Italian\noccupation zones,[92] and an unoccupied rump state under the Vichy Regime,\nwhich, though officially neutral, was generally aligned with Germany.

In November 1939, the American Neutrality Act\nwas amended to allow \"cash and carry\" purchases by the Allies.[100] In 1940,\nfollowing the German capture of Paris, the size of the United States Navy was\nsignificantly increased. In September, the United States further agreed to a\ntrade of American destroyers for British bases.[101] Still, a large majority\nof the American public continued to oppose any direct military intervention\ninto the conflict well into 1941.[102]\n\nAlthough Roosevelt had promised to keep the United States out of the war, he\nnevertheless took concrete steps to prepare for war. In December 1940 he\naccused Hitler of planning world conquest and ruled out negotiations as\nuseless, calling for the US to become an \"arsenal for democracy\" and promoted\nthe passage of Lend-Lease aid to support the British war effort.[96] In\nJanuary 1941 secret high level staff talks with the British began for the\npurposes of determining how to defeat Germany should the US enter the war.\nThey decided on a number of offensive policies, including an air offensive,\nthe \"early elimination\" of Italy, raids, support of resistance groups, and the\ncapture of positions to launch an offensive against Germany.[103]\n\nAt the end of September 1940, the Tripartite Pact united Japan, Italy and\nGermany to formalise the Axis Powers. The Tripartite Pact stipulated that any\ncountry, with the exception of the Soviet Union, not in the war which attacked\nany Axis Power would be forced to go to war against all three.[104] The Axis\nexpanded in November 1940 when Hungary, Slovakia and Romania joined the\nTripartite Pact.[105] Romania would make a major contribution (as did Hungary)\nto the Axis war against the USSR, partially to recapture territory ceded to\nthe USSR, partially to pursue its leader Ion Antonescu's desire to combat\ncommunism.[106]\n\n### Mediterranean (1940\u201341)\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/9_Div_Tobruk%28AWM_020\n779%29.jpg/220px-9_Div_Tobruk%28AWM_020779%29.jpg)\n\nAustralian troops of the British Commonwealth Forces man a front-line trench\nduring the Siege of Tobruk; North African Campaign, August 1941\n\nItaly began operations in the Mediterranean, initiating a siege of Malta in\nJune, conquering British Somaliland in August, and making an incursion into\nBritish-held Egypt in September 1940. In October 1940, Italy started the\nGreco-Italian War because of Mussolini's jealousy of Hitler's success but\nwithin days was repulsed and pushed back into Albania, where a stalemate soon\noccurred.[107] The United Kingdom responded to Greek requests for assistance\nby sending troops to Crete and providing air support to Greece. Hitler decided\nthat when the weather improved he would take action against Greece to assist\nthe Italians and prevent the British from gaining a foothold in the Balkans,\nto strike against the British naval dominance of the Mediterranean, and to\nsecure his hold on Romanian oil.[108]\n\nIn December 1940, British Commonwealth forces began counter-offensives against\nItalian forces in Egypt and Italian East Africa.[109] The offensive in North\nAfrica was highly successful and by early February 1941 Italy had lost control\nof eastern Libya and large numbers of Italian troops had been taken prisoner.\nThe Italian Navy also suffered significant defeats, with the Royal Navy\nputting three Italian battleships out of commission by a carrier attack at\nTaranto, and neutralising several more warships at the Battle of Cape\nMatapan.[110]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/E_003743_E.jpg/220px-\nE_003743_E.jpg)\n\nCaptured German Afrika Korps soldiers, December 1941\n\nThe Germans soon intervened to assist Italy. Hitler sent German forces to\nLibya in February, and by the end of March they had launched an offensive\nwhich drove back the Commonwealth forces which had been weakened to support\nGreece.[111] In under a month, Commonwealth forces were pushed back into Egypt\nwith the exception of the besieged port of Tobruk.[112] The Commonwealth\nattempted to dislodge Axis forces in May and again in June, but failed on both\noccasions.[113]\n\nBy late March 1941, following Bulgaria's signing of the Tripartite Pact, the\nGermans were in position to intervene in Greece. Plans were changed, however,\nbecause of developments in neighbouring Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav government\nhad signed the Tripartite Pact on 25 March, only to be overthrown two days\nlater by a British-encouraged coup. Hitler viewed the new regime as hostile\nand immediately decided to eliminate it. On 6 April Germany simultaneously\ninvaded both Yugoslavia and Greece, making rapid progress and forcing both\nnations to surrender within the month. The British were driven from the\nBalkans after Germany conquered the Greek island of Crete by the end of\nMay.[114] Although the Axis victory was swift, bitter partisan warfare\nsubsequently broke out against the Axis occupation of Yugoslavia, which\ncontinued until the end of the war.\n\nThe Allies did have some successes during this time. In the Middle East,\nCommonwealth forces first quashed an uprising in Iraq which had been supported\nby German aircraft from bases within Vichy-controlled Syria,[115] then, with\nthe assistance of the Free French, invaded Syria and Lebanon to prevent\nfurther such occurrences.[116]\n\n### Axis attack on the USSR (1941)\n\nFurther information: Operation Barbarossa, Einsatzgruppen, World War II\ncasualties of the Soviet Union and Nazi crimes against Soviet POWs\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/RIAN_archive_2153_Afte\nr_bombing.jpg/220px-RIAN_archive_2153_After_bombing.jpg)\n\nSoviet civilians in Leningrad leaving destroyed houses, after a German\nbombardment of the city; Battle of Leningrad, 10 December 1942\n\nWith the situation in Europe and Asia relatively stable, Germany, Japan, and\nthe Soviet Union made preparations. With the Soviets wary of mounting tensions\nwith Germany and the Japanese planning to take advantage of the European War\nby seizing resource-rich European possessions in Southeast Asia, the two\npowers signed the Soviet\u2013Japanese Neutrality Pact in April 1941.[117] By\ncontrast, the Germans were steadily making preparations for an attack on the\nSoviet Union, massing forces on the Soviet border.[118]\n\nHitler believed that Britain's refusal to end the war was based on the hope\nthat the United States and the Soviet Union would enter the war against\nGermany sooner or later.[119] He therefore decided to try to strengthen\nGermany's relations with the Soviets, or failing that, to attack and eliminate\nthem as a factor. In November 1940, negotiations took place to determine if\nthe Soviet Union would join the Tripartite Pact. The Soviets showed some\ninterest, but asked for concessions from Finland, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Japan\nthat Germany considered unacceptable. On 18 December 1940, Hitler issued the\ndirective to prepare for an invasion of the Soviet Union.\n\nOn 22 June 1941, Germany, supported by Italy and Romania, invaded the Soviet\nUnion in Operation Barbarossa, with Germany accusing the Soviets of plotting\nagainst them. They were joined shortly by Finland and Hungary.[120] The\nprimary targets of this surprise offensive[121] were the Baltic region, Moscow\nand Ukraine, with the ultimate goal of ending the 1941 campaign near the\nArkhangelsk-Astrakhan line, from the Caspian to the White Seas. Hitler's\nobjectives were to eliminate the Soviet Union as a military power, exterminate\nCommunism, generate _Lebensraum_ (\"living space\")[122] by dispossessing the\nnative population[123] and guarantee access to the strategic resources needed\nto defeat Germany's remaining rivals.[124]\n\nAlthough the Red Army was preparing for strategic counter-offensives before\nthe war,[125] _Barbarossa_ forced the Soviet supreme command to adopt a\nstrategic defence. During the summer, the Axis made significant gains into\nSoviet territory, inflicting immense losses in both personnel and materiel. By\nthe middle of August, however, the German Army High Command decided to suspend\nthe offensive of a considerably depleted Army Group Centre, and to divert the\n2nd Panzer Group to reinforce troops advancing towards central Ukraine and\nLeningrad.[126] The Kiev offensive was overwhelmingly successful, resulting in\nencirclement and elimination of four Soviet armies, and made further advance\ninto Crimea and industrially developed Eastern Ukraine (the First Battle of\nKharkov) possible.[127]\n\nThe diversion of three quarters of the Axis troops and the majority of their\nair forces from France and the central Mediterranean to the Eastern Front[128]\nprompted Britain to reconsider its grand strategy.[129] In July, the UK and\nthe Soviet Union formed a military alliance against Germany[130] The British\nand Soviets invaded Iran to secure the Persian Corridor and Iran's oil\nfields.[131] In August, the United Kingdom and the United States jointly\nissued the Atlantic Charter.[132]\n\nBy October Axis operational objectives in Ukraine and the Baltic region were\nachieved, with only the sieges of Leningrad[133] and Sevastopol\ncontinuing.[134] A major offensive against Moscow was renewed; after two\nmonths of fierce battles in increasingly harsh weather the German army almost\nreached the outer suburbs of Moscow, where the exhausted troops[135] were\nforced to suspend their offensive.[136] Large territorial gains were made by\nAxis forces, but their campaign had failed to achieve its main objectives: two\nkey cities remained in Soviet hands, the Soviet capability to resist was not\nbroken, and the Soviet Union retained a considerable part of its military\npotential. The _blitzkrieg_ phase of the war in Europe had ended.[137]\n\nBy early December, freshly mobilised reserves[138] allowed the Soviets to\nachieve numerical parity with Axis troops.[139] This, as well as intelligence\ndata which established that a minimal number of Soviet troops in the East\nwould be sufficient to deter any attack by the Japanese Kwantung Army,[140]\nallowed the Soviets to begin a massive counter-offensive that started on 5\nDecember all along the front and pushed German troops 100\u2013250 kilometres\n(62\u2013155\u00a0mi) west.[141]\n\n### War breaks out in the Pacific (1941)\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Carrier_shokaku.jpg\n/220px-Carrier_shokaku.jpg)\n\nMitsubishi A6M2 \"Zero\" fighters on the Imperial Japanese Navy aircraft carrier\n_Sh\u014dkaku_, just before the attack on Pearl Harbor\n\nIn 1939 the United States had renounced its trade treaty with Japan and\nbeginning with an aviation gasoline ban in July 1940 Japan had become subject\nto increasing economic pressure.[96] During this time, Japan launched its\nfirst attack against Changsha, a strategically important Chinese city, but was\nrepulsed by late September.[142] Despite several offensives by both sides, the\nwar between China and Japan was stalemated by 1940. To increase pressure on\nChina by blocking supply routes, and to better position Japanese forces in the\nevent of a war with the Western powers, Japan invaded and occupied northern\nIndochina.[143] Afterwards, the United States embargoed iron, steel and\nmechanical parts against Japan.[144] Other sanctions soon followed.\n\nIn August of that year, Chinese communists launched an offensive in Central\nChina; in retaliation, Japan instituted harsh measures in occupied areas to\nreduce human and material resources for the communists.[145] Continued\nantipathy between Chinese communist and nationalist forces culminated in armed\nclashes in January 1941, effectively ending their co-operation.[146] In March,\nthe Japanese 11th army attacked the headquarters of the Chinese 19th army but\nwas repulsed during Battle of Shanggao.[147] In September, Japan attempted to\ntake the city of Changsha again and clashed with Chinese nationalist\nforces.[148]\n\nGerman successes in Europe encouraged Japan to increase pressure on European\ngovernments in Southeast Asia. The Dutch government agreed to provide Japan\nsome oil supplies from the Dutch East Indies, but negotiations for additional\naccess to their resources ended in failure in June 1941.[149] In July 1941\nJapan sent troops to southern Indochina, thus threatening British and Dutch\npossessions in the Far East. The United States, United Kingdom and other\nWestern governments reacted to this move with a freeze on Japanese assets and\na total oil embargo.[150][151]\n\nSince early 1941 the United States and Japan had been engaged in negotiations\nin an attempt to improve their strained relations and end the war in China.\nDuring these negotiations Japan advanced a number of proposals which were\ndismissed by the Americans as inadequate.[152] At the same time the US,\nBritain, and the Netherlands engaged in secret discussions for the joint\ndefence of their territories, in the event of a Japanese attack against any of\nthem.[153] Roosevelt reinforced the Philippines (an American protectorate\nscheduled for independence in 1946) and warned Japan that the US would react\nto Japanese attacks against any \"neighboring countries\".[153]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/The_USS_Arizona_%28BB-\n39%29_burning_after_the_Japanese_attack_on_Pearl_Harbor_-_NARA_195617_-\n_Edit.jpg/220px-The_USS_Arizona_%28BB-39\n%29_burning_after_the_Japanese_attack_on_Pearl_Harbor_-_NARA_195617_-\n_Edit.jpg)\n\nUSS\u00a0_Arizona_ during the Japanese surprise air attack on the American pacific\nfleet, 7 December 1941\n\nFrustrated at the lack of progress and feeling the pinch of the American-\nBritish-Dutch sanctions, Japan prepared for war. On 20 November it presented\nan interim proposal as its final offer. It called for the end of American aid\nto China and to supply oil and other resources to Japan. In exchange they\npromised not to launch any attacks in Southeast Asia and to withdraw their\nforces from their threatening positions in southern Indochina.[152] The\nAmerican counter-proposal of 26 November required that Japan evacuate all of\nChina without conditions and conclude non-aggression pacts with all Pacific\npowers.[154] That meant Japan was essentially forced to choose between\nabandoning its ambitions in China, or seizing the natural resources it needed\nin the Dutch East Indies by force;[155] the Japanese military did not consider\nthe former an option, and many officers considered the oil embargo an unspoken\ndeclaration of war.[156]\n\nJapan planned to rapidly seize European colonies in Asia to create a large\ndefensive perimeter stretching into the Central Pacific; the Japanese would\nthen be free to exploit the resources of Southeast Asia while exhausting the\nover-stretched Allies by fighting a defensive war.[157] To prevent American\nintervention while securing the perimeter it was further planned to neutralise\nthe United States Pacific Fleet and the American military presence in the\nPhilippines from the outset.[158] On 7 December 1941 (8 December in Asian time\nzones), Japan attacked British and American holdings with near-simultaneous\noffensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific.[159] These included\nan attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor, the Philippines, landings in\nThailand and Malaya[159] and the battle of Hong Kong.\n\nThese attacks led the United States, Britain, China, Australia and several\nother states to formally declare war on Japan, whereas the Soviet Union, being\nheavily involved in large-scale hostilities with European Axis countries,\nmaintained its neutrality agreement with Japan.[160] Germany, followed by the\nother Axis states, declared war on the United States[161] in solidarity with\nJapan, citing as justification the American attacks on German war vessels that\nhad been ordered by Roosevelt.[120][162]\n\n### Axis advance stalls (1942\u201343)\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Casablanca-\nConference.jpg/220px-Casablanca-Conference.jpg)\n\nSeated at the Casablanca Conference; US President Franklin D. Roosevelt and\nBritish PM Winston Churchill, January 1943\n\nIn January 1942, the Big Four (the United States, Britain, Soviet Union,\nChina) and 22 smaller or exiled governments issued the Declaration by United\nNations, thereby affirming the Atlantic Charter,[163] and agreeing to not to\nsign a separate peace with the Axis powers.\n\nDuring 1942, Allied officials debated on the appropriate grand strategy to\npursue. All agreed that defeating Germany was the primary objective. The\nAmericans favoured a straightforward, large-scale attack on Germany through\nFrance. The Soviets were also demanding a second front. The British, on the\nother hand, argued that military operations should target peripheral areas to\nwear out German strength, lead to increasing demoralisation, and bolster\nresistance forces. Germany itself would be subject to a heavy bombing\ncampaign. An offensive against Germany would then be launched primarily by\nAllied armour without using large-scale armies.[164] Eventually, the British\npersuaded the Americans that a landing in France was infeasible in 1942 and\nthey should instead focus on driving the Axis out of North Africa.[165]\n\nAt the Casablanca Conference in early 1943, the Allies reiterated the\nstatements issued in the 1942 Declaration by the United Nations, and demanded\nthe unconditional surrender of their enemies. The British and Americans agreed\nto continue to press the initiative in the Mediterranean by invading Sicily to\nfully secure the Mediterranean supply routes.[166] Although the British argued\nfor further operations in the Balkans to bring Turkey into the war, in May\n1943, the Americans extracted a British commitment to limit Allied operations\nin the Mediterranean to an invasion of the Italian mainland and to invade\nFrance in 1944.[167]\n\n#### Pacific (1942\u201343)\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Second_world_war_asia_\n1937-1942_map_en6.png/350px-Second_world_war_asia_1937-1942_map_en6.png)\n\nMap of Japanese military advances, until mid-1942\n\nBy the end of April 1942, Japan and its ally Thailand had almost fully\nconquered Burma, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, and Rabaul,\ninflicting severe losses on Allied troops and taking a large number of\nprisoners.[168] Despite stubborn resistance by Filipino and US forces, the\nPhilippine Commonwealth was eventually captured in May 1942, forcing its\ngovernment into exile.[169] On 16 April, in Burma, 7,000 British soldiers were\nencircled by the Japanese 33rd Division during the Battle of Yenangyaung and\nrescued by the Chinese 38th Division.[170] Japanese forces also achieved naval\nvictories in the South China Sea, Java Sea and Indian Ocean,[171] and bombed\nthe Allied naval base at Darwin, Australia. In January 1942, the only Allied\nsuccess against Japan was a Chinese victory at Changsha.[172] These easy\nvictories over unprepared US and European opponents left Japan overconfident,\nas well as overextended.[173]\n\nIn early May 1942, Japan initiated operations to capture Port Moresby by\namphibious assault and thus sever communications and supply lines between the\nUnited States and Australia. The planned invasion was thwarted when an Allied\ntask force centered on two American fleet carriers fought Japanese naval\nforces to a draw in the Battle of the Coral Sea.[174] Japan's next plan,\nmotivated by the earlier Doolittle Raid, was to seize Midway Atoll and lure\nAmerican carriers into battle to be eliminated; as a diversion, Japan would\nalso send forces to occupy the Aleutian Islands in Alaska.[175] In early June,\nJapan put its operations into action but the Americans, having broken Japanese\nnaval codes in late May, were fully aware of the plans and force dispositions\nand used this knowledge to achieve a decisive victory at Midway over the\nImperial Japanese Navy.[176]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Marines_rest_in_the_fi\neld_on_Guadalcanal.jpg/220px-Marines_rest_in_the_field_on_Guadalcanal.jpg)\n\nUS Marines during the Guadalcanal Campaign, in the Pacific theatre, 1942\n\nWith its capacity for aggressive action greatly diminished as a result of the\nMidway battle, Japan chose to focus on a belated attempt to capture Port\nMoresby by an overland campaign in the Territory of Papua.[177] The Americans\nplanned a counter-attack against Japanese positions in the southern Solomon\nIslands, primarily Guadalcanal, as a first step towards capturing Rabaul, the\nmain Japanese base in Southeast Asia.[178]\n\nBoth plans started in July, but by mid-September, the Battle for Guadalcanal\ntook priority for the Japanese, and troops in New Guinea were ordered to\nwithdraw from the Port Moresby area to the northern part of the island, where\nthey faced Australian and United States troops in the Battle of Buna-\nGona.[179] Guadalcanal soon became a focal point for both sides with heavy\ncommitments of troops and ships in the battle for Guadalcanal. By the start of\n1943, the Japanese were defeated on the island and withdrew their troops.[180]\nIn Burma, Commonwealth forces mounted two operations. The first, an offensive\ninto the Arakan region in late 1942, went disastrously, forcing a retreat back\nto India by May 1943.[181] The second was the insertion of irregular forces\nbehind Japanese front-lines in February which, by the end of April, had\nachieved mixed results.[182]\n\n#### Eastern Front (1942\u201343)\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/RIAN_archive_44732_Sov\niet_soldiers_attack_house.jpg/300px-\nRIAN_archive_44732_Soviet_soldiers_attack_house.jpg)\n\nRed Army soldiers on the counterattack, during the Battle of Stalingrad,\nFebruary 1943\n\nDespite considerable losses, in early 1942 Germany and its allies stopped a\nmajor Soviet offensive in central and southern Russia, keeping most\nterritorial gains they had achieved during the previous year.[183] In May the\nGermans defeated Soviet offensives in the Kerch Peninsula and at Kharkiv,[184]\nand then launched their main summer offensive against southern Russia in June\n1942, to seize the oil fields of the Caucasus and occupy Kuban steppe, while\nmaintaining positions on the northern and central areas of the front. The\nGermans split Army Group South into two groups: Army Group A advanced to the\nlower Don River and struck south-east to the Caucasus, while Army Group B\nheaded towards the Volga River. The Soviets decided to make their stand at\nStalingrad on the Volga.[185]\n\nBy mid-November, the Germans had nearly taken Stalingrad in bitter street\nfighting when the Soviets began their second winter counter-offensive,\nstarting with an encirclement of German forces at Stalingrad[186] and an\nassault on the Rzhev salient near Moscow, though the latter failed\ndisastrously.[187] By early February 1943, the German Army had taken\ntremendous losses; German troops at Stalingrad had been forced to\nsurrender,[188] and the front-line had been pushed back beyond its position\nbefore the summer offensive. In mid-February, after the Soviet push had\ntapered off, the Germans launched another attack on Kharkiv, creating a\nsalient in their front line around the Russian city of Kursk.[189]\n\n#### Western Europe/Atlantic &amp; Mediterranean (1942\u201343)\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/8th_AF_Bombing_Marienb\nurg.JPEG/220px-8th_AF_Bombing_Marienburg.JPEG)\n\nAn American B-17 bombing raid, by the 8th Air Force, on the Focke Wulf factory\nin Germany, 9 October 1943\n\nExploiting poor American naval command decisions, the German navy ravaged\nAllied shipping off the American Atlantic coast.[190] By November 1941,\nCommonwealth forces had launched a counter-offensive, Operation Crusader, in\nNorth Africa, and reclaimed all the gains the Germans and Italians had\nmade.[191] In North Africa, the Germans launched an offensive in January,\npushing the British back to positions at the Gazala Line by early\nFebruary,[192] followed by a temporary lull in combat which Germany used to\nprepare for their upcoming offensives.[193] Concerns the Japanese might use\nbases in Vichy-held Madagascar caused the British to invade the island in\nearly May 1942.[194] An Axis offensive in Libya forced an Allied retreat deep\ninside Egypt until Axis forces were stopped at El Alamein.[195] On the\nContinent, raids of Allied commandos on strategic targets, culminating in the\ndisastrous Dieppe Raid,[196] demonstrated the Western Allies' inability to\nlaunch an invasion of continental Europe without much better preparation,\nequipment, and operational security.[197]\n\nIn August 1942, the Allies succeeded in repelling a second attack against El\nAlamein[198] and, at a high cost, managed to deliver desperately needed\nsupplies to the besieged Malta.[199] A few months later, the Allies commenced\nan attack of their own in Egypt, dislodging the Axis forces and beginning a\ndrive west across Libya.[200] This attack was followed up shortly after by\nAnglo-American landings in French North Africa, which resulted in the region\njoining the Allies.[201] Hitler responded to the French colony's defection by\nordering the occupation of Vichy France;[201] although Vichy forces did not\nresist this violation of the armistice, they managed to scuttle their fleet to\nprevent its capture by German forces.[202] The now pincered Axis forces in\nAfrica withdrew into Tunisia, which was conquered by the Allies in May\n1943.[203]\n\nIn early 1943 the British and Americans began the Combined Bomber Offensive, a\nstrategic bombing campaign against Germany.

On 4\nJuly 1943, Germany attacked Soviet forces around the Kursk Bulge. Within a\nweek, German forces had exhausted themselves against the Soviets' deeply\necheloned and well-constructed defences[208] and, for the first time in the\nwar, Hitler cancelled the operation before it had achieved tactical or\noperational success.[209] This decision was partially affected by the Western\nAllies' invasion of Sicily launched on 9 July which, combined with previous\nItalian failures, resulted in the ousting and arrest of Mussolini later that\nmonth.[210] Also, in July 1943 the British firebombed Hamburg killing over\n40,000 people.\n\nOn 12 July 1943, the Soviets launched their own counter-offensives, thereby\ndispelling any chance of German victory or even stalemate in the east. The\nSoviet victory at Kursk marked the end of German superiority,[211] giving the\nSoviet Union the initiative on the Eastern Front.[212][213] The Germans tried\nto stabilise their eastern front along the hastily fortified Panther-Wotan\nline, but the Soviets broke through it at Smolensk and by the Lower Dnieper\nOffensives.[214]\n\nOn 3 September 1943, the Western Allies invaded the Italian mainland,\nfollowing Italy's armistice with the Allies.[215] Germany responded by\ndisarming Italian forces, seizing military control of Italian areas,[216] and\ncreating a series of defensive lines.[217] German special forces then rescued\nMussolini, who then soon established a new client state in German occupied\nItaly named the Italian Social Republic,[218] causing an Italian civil war.\nThe Western Allies fought through several lines until reaching the main German\ndefensive line in mid-November.[219]\n\n![Three men, Chiang Kai-shek, Roosevelt and Churchill, sitting together elbow\nto elbow](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Cairo_conference\n.jpg/220px-Cairo_conference.jpg)\n\nThe Allied leaders of the Asian and Pacific Theater: Generalissimo Chiang Kai-\nshek, Franklin D.

This delay slowed subsequent Soviet operations in the Baltic Sea\nregion.[229] By late May 1944, the Soviets had liberated Crimea, largely\nexpelled Axis forces from Ukraine, and made incursions into Romania, which\nwere repulsed by the Axis troops.[230] The Allied offensives in Italy had\nsucceeded and, at the expense of allowing several German divisions to retreat,\non 4 June, Rome was captured.[231]\n\nThe Allies had mixed success in mainland Asia. In March 1944, the Japanese\nlaunched the first of two invasions, an operation against British positions in\nAssam, India,[232] and soon besieged Commonwealth positions at Imphal and\nKohima.[233] In May 1944, British forces mounted a counter-offensive that\ndrove Japanese troops back to Burma,[233] and Chinese forces that had invaded\nnorthern Burma in late 1943 besieged Japanese troops in Myitkyina.[234] The\nsecond Japanese invasion of China aimed to destroy China's main fighting\nforces, secure railways between Japanese-held territory and capture Allied\nairfields.[235] By June, the Japanese had conquered the province of Henan and\nbegun a new attack on Changsha in the Hunan province.[236]\n\n### Allies close in (1944)\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Approaching_Omaha.jpg\n/220px-Approaching_Omaha.jpg)\n\nAmerican troops approaching Omaha Beach, during the Invasion of Normandy on\nD-Day, 6 June 1944\n\nOn 6 June 1944 (known as D-Day), after three years of Soviet pressure,[237]\nthe Western Allies invaded northern France.

An attempt to advance into northern Germany\nspearheaded by a major airborne operation in the Netherlands failed.[240]\nAfter that, the Western Allies slowly pushed into Germany, but failed to cross\nthe Rur river in a large offensive. In Italy, Allied advance also slowed due\nto the last major German defensive line.[241]\n\nOn 22 June, the Soviets launched a strategic offensive in Belarus (\"Operation\nBagration\") that destroyed the German Army Group Centre almost\ncompletely.[242] Soon after that another Soviet strategic offensive forced\nGerman troops from Western Ukraine and Eastern Poland.

However, the largest of these in Warsaw where German\nsoldiers massacred 200,000 civilians and a national uprising in Slovakia did\nnot receive Soviet support and were subsequently suppressed by the\nGermans.[243] The Red Army's strategic offensive in eastern Romania cut off\nand destroyed the considerable German troops there and triggered a successful\ncoup d'\u00e9tat in Romania and in Bulgaria, followed by those countries' shift to\nthe Allied side.[244]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-\n97906%2C_Warschauer_Aufstand%2C_Stra%C3%9Fenkampf.jpg/220px-\nBundesarchiv_Bild_183-97906%2C_Warschauer_Aufstand%2C_Stra%C3%9Fenkampf.jpg)\n\nGerman SS soldiers from the Dirlewanger Brigade, tasked with suppressing the\nWarsaw Uprising against Nazi occupation, August 1944\n\nIn September 1944, Soviet troops advanced into Yugoslavia and forced the rapid\nwithdrawal of German Army Groups E and F in Greece, Albania and Yugoslavia to\nrescue them from being cut off.[245] By this point, the Communist-led\nPartisans under Marshal Josip Broz Tito, who had led an increasingly\nsuccessful guerrilla campaign against the occupation since 1941, controlled\nmuch of the territory of Yugoslavia and engaged in delaying efforts against\nGerman forces further south. In northern Serbia, the Red Army, with limited\nsupport from Bulgarian forces, assisted the Partisans in a joint liberation of\nthe capital city of Belgrade on 20 October. A few days later, the Soviets\nlaunched a massive assault against German-occupied Hungary that lasted until\nthe fall of Budapest in February 1945.[246] Unlike impressive Soviet victories\nin the Balkans, bitter Finnish resistance to the Soviet offensive in the\nKarelian Isthmus denied the Soviets occupation of Finland and led to a Soviet-\nFinnish armistice on relatively mild conditions,[247][248] although Finland\nlater shifted to the Allied side.\n\nBy the start of July 1944, Commonwealth forces in Southeast Asia had repelled\nthe Japanese sieges in Assam, pushing the Japanese back to the Chindwin\nRiver[249] while the Chinese captured Myitkyina. In China, the Japanese had\nmore successes, having finally captured Changsha in mid-June and the city of\nHengyang by early August.[250] Soon after, they invaded the province of\nGuangxi, winning major engagements against Chinese forces at Guilin and\nLiuzhou by the end of November[251] and successfully linking up their forces\nin China and Indochina by mid-December.[252]\n\nIn the Pacific, US forces continued to press back the Japanese perimeter. In\nmid-June 1944, they began their offensive against the Mariana and Palau\nislands, and decisively defeated Japanese forces in the Battle of the\nPhilippine Sea. These defeats led to the resignation of the Japanese Prime\nMinister, Hideki Tojo, and provided the United States with air bases to launch\nintensive heavy bomber attacks on the Japanese home islands.

Benito Mussolini\nwas killed by Italian partisans on 28 April.[259] Two days later, Hitler\ncommitted suicide, and was succeeded by Grand Admiral Karl D\u00f6nitz.[260]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Reichstag_after_the_al\nlied_bombing_of_Berlin.jpg/220px-\nReichstag_after_the_allied_bombing_of_Berlin.jpg)\n\nThe German Reichstag after its capture by the Allies, 3 June 1945\n\nGerman forces surrendered in Italy on 29 April. Total and unconditional\nsurrender was signed on 7 May, to be effective by the end of 8 May.[261]\nGerman Army Group Centre resisted in Prague until 11 May.[262]\n\nIn the Pacific theatre, American forces accompanied by the forces of the\nPhilippine Commonwealth advanced in the Philippines, clearing Leyte by the end\nof April 1945. They landed on Luzon in January 1945 and recaptured Manila in\nMarch following a battle which reduced the city to ruins. Fighting continued\non Luzon, Mindanao, and other islands of the Philippines until the end of the\nwar.[263] On the night of 9\u201310 March, B-29 bombers of the US Army Air Forces\nstruck Tokyo with incendiary bombs, which killed 100,000 people within a few\nhours. Over the next five months, American bombers firebombed 66 other\nJapanese cities, causing the destruction of untold numbers of buildings and\nthe deaths of between 350,000\u2013500,000 Japanese civilians.[264]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Shigemitsu-signs-\nsurrender.jpg/220px-Shigemitsu-signs-surrender.jpg)\n\nJapanese foreign affairs minister Mamoru Shigemitsu signs the Japanese\nInstrument of Surrender on board the USS _Missouri_, 2 September 1945\n\nIn May 1945, Australian troops landed in Borneo, over-running the oilfields\nthere. British, American, and Chinese forces defeated the Japanese in northern\nBurma in March, and the British pushed on to reach Rangoon by 3 May.[265]\nChinese forces started to counterattack in Battle of West Hunan that occurred\nbetween 6 April and 7 June 1945. American naval and amphibious forces also\nmoved towards Japan, taking Iwo Jima by March, and Okinawa by the end of\nJune.[266] At the same time American bombers were destroying Japanese cities,\nAmerican submarines cut off Japanese imports, drastically reducing Japan's\nability to supply its overseas forces.[267]\n\nOn 11 July, Allied leaders met in Potsdam, Germany. They confirmed earlier\nagreements about Germany,[268] and reiterated the demand for unconditional\nsurrender of all Japanese forces by Japan, specifically stating that \"the\nalternative for Japan is prompt and utter destruction\".[269] During this\nconference, the United Kingdom held its general election, and Clement Attlee\nreplaced Churchill as Prime Minister.[270]\n\nThe Allies called for unconditional Japanese surrender in the Potsdam\ndeclaration of 27 July, but the Japanese government was internally divided on\nwhether to make peace and did not respond. In early August, the United States\ndropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Like\nthe Japanese cities previously bombed by American airmen, the US and its\nallies justified the atomic bombings as military necessity to avoid invading\nthe Japanese home islands which would cost the lives of between\n250,000\u2013500,000 Allied troops and millions of Japanese troops and\ncivilians.[271] Between the two bombings, the Soviets, pursuant to the Yalta\nagreement, invaded Japanese-held Manchuria, and quickly defeated the Kwantung\nArmy, which was the largest Japanese fighting force.[272][273] The Red Army\nalso captured Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands. On 15 August 1945, Japan\nsurrendered, with the surrender documents finally signed aboard the deck of\nthe American battleship USS _Missouri_ on 2 September 1945, ending the\nwar.[274]\n\n## Aftermath\n\nMain articles: Aftermath of World War II and Consequences of Nazism\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Destroyed_Warsaw%2C_ca\npital_of_Poland%2C_January_1945.jpg/220px-\nDestroyed_Warsaw%2C_capital_of_Poland%2C_January_1945.jpg)\n\nRuins of Warsaw in January 1945, after the deliberate destruction of the city\nby the occupying German forces\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/EasternBloc_BorderChan\nge38-48.svg/180px-EasternBloc_BorderChange38-48.svg.png)\n\nPost-war Soviet territorial expansion; resulted in Central European border\nchanges, the creation of a Communist Bloc, and start of the Cold War\n\nThe Allies established occupation administrations in Austria and Germany. The\nformer became a neutral state, non-aligned with any political bloc. The latter\nwas divided into western and eastern occupation zones controlled by the\nWestern Allies and the USSR, accordingly. A denazification program in Germany\nled to the prosecution of Nazi war criminals and the removal of ex-Nazis from\npower, although this policy moved towards amnesty and re-integration of ex-\nNazis into West German society.[275]\n\nGermany lost a quarter of its pre-war (1937) territory. Among the eastern\nterritories, Silesia, Neumark and most of Pomerania were taken over by Poland,\nEast Prussia was divided between Poland and the USSR, followed by the\nexpulsion of the 9 million Germans from these provinces, as well as the\nexpulsion of 3 million Germans from the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia to\nGermany. By the 1950s, every fifth West German was a refugee from the east.\nThe Soviet Union also took over the Polish provinces east of the Curzon line,\nfrom which 2 million Poles were expelled;[276] north-east Romania,[277][278]\nparts of eastern Finland,[279] and the three Baltic states were also\nincorporated into the USSR.[280][281]\n\nIn an effort to maintain peace,[282] the Allies formed the United Nations,\nwhich officially came into existence on 24 October 1945,[283] and adopted the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, as a common standard for all\nmember nations.[284] The great powers that were the victors of the war\u2014the\nUnited States, Soviet Union, China, Britain, and France\u2014formed the permanent\nmembers of the UN's Security Council.[7] The five permanent members remain so\nto the present, although there have been two seat changes, between the\nRepublic of China and the People's Republic of China in 1971, and between the\nSoviet Union and its successor state, the Russian Federation, following the\ndissolution of the Soviet Union. The alliance between the Western Allies and\nthe Soviet Union had begun to deteriorate even before the war was over.[285]\n\nGermany had been _de facto_ divided, and two independent states, the Federal\nRepublic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic[286] were created\nwithin the borders of Allied and Soviet occupation zones, accordingly. The\nrest of Europe was also divided into Western and Soviet spheres of\ninfluence.[287] Most eastern and central European countries fell into the\nSoviet sphere, which led to establishment of Communist-led regimes, with full\nor partial support of the Soviet occupation authorities. As a result, Poland,\nHungary, East Germany,[288] Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Albania[289] became\nSoviet satellite states. Communist Yugoslavia conducted a fully independent\npolicy, causing tension with the USSR.[290]\n\nPost-war division of the world was formalised by two international military\nalliances, the United States-led NATO and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact;[291] the\nlong period of political tensions and military competition between them, the\nCold War, would be accompanied by an unprecedented arms race and proxy\nwars.[292]\n\nIn Asia, the United States led the occupation of Japan and administrated\nJapan's former islands in the Western Pacific, while the Soviets annexed\nSakhalin and the Kuril Islands.[293] Korea, formerly under Japanese rule, was\ndivided and occupied by the US in the South and the Soviet Union in the North\nbetween 1945 and 1948. Separate republics emerged on both sides of the 38th\nparallel in 1948, each claiming to be the legitimate government for all of\nKorea, which led ultimately to the Korean War.[294]\n\nIn China, nationalist and communist forces resumed the civil war in June 1946.\nCommunist forces were victorious and established the People's Republic of\nChina on the mainland, while nationalist forces retreated to Taiwan in\n1949.[295] In the Middle East, the Arab rejection of the United Nations\nPartition Plan for Palestine and the creation of Israel marked the escalation\nof the Arab-Israeli conflict. While European colonial powers attempted to\nretain some or all of their colonial empires, their losses of prestige and\nresources during the war rendered this unsuccessful, leading to\ndecolonisation.[296][297]\n\nThe global economy suffered heavily from the war, although participating\nnations were affected differently. The US emerged much richer than any other\nnation; it had a baby boom and by 1950 its gross domestic product per person\nwas much higher than that of any of the other powers and it dominated the\nworld economy.[298] The UK and US pursued a policy of industrial disarmament\nin Western Germany in the years 1945\u20131948.[299] Because of international trade\ninterdependencies this led to European economic stagnation and delayed\nEuropean recovery for several years.[300][301]\n\nRecovery began with the mid-1948 currency reform in Western Germany, and was\nsped up by the liberalisation of European economic policy that the Marshall\nPlan (1948\u20131951) both directly and indirectly caused.[302][303] The post-1948\nWest German recovery has been called the German economic miracle.[304] Italy\nalso experienced an economic boom[305] and the French economy rebounded.[306]\nBy contrast, the United Kingdom was in a state of economic ruin,[307] and\nalthough it received a quarter of the total Marshall Plan assistance, more\nthan any other European country,[308] continued relative economic decline for\ndecades.[309]\n\nThe Soviet Union, despite enormous human and material losses, also experienced\nrapid increase in production in the immediate post-war era.[310] Japan\nexperienced incredibly rapid economic growth, becoming one of the most\npowerful economies in the world by the 1980s.[311] China returned to its pre-\nwar industrial production by 1952.[312]\n\n## Impact\n\n### Casualties and war crimes\n\nMain articles: World War II casualties, War crimes during World War II, War\ncrimes in occupied Poland during World War II, German war crimes, War crimes\nof the Wehrmacht, Italian war crimes, Japanese war crimes, Allied war crimes\nduring World War II and Soviet war crimes\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/World_War_II_Casualtie\ns2.svg/425px-World_War_II_Casualties2.svg.png)\n\nWorld War II deaths\n\nEstimates for the total number of casualties in the war vary, because many\ndeaths went unrecorded. Most suggest that some 75 million people died in the\nwar, including about 20 million military personnel and 40 million\ncivilians.[313][314][315] Many of the civilians died because of deliberate\ngenocide, massacres, mass-bombings, disease, and starvation.\n\nThe Soviet Union lost around 27 million people during the war,[316] including\n8.7 million military and 19 million civilian deaths. The largest portion of\nmilitary dead were 5.7 million ethnic Russians, followed by 1.3 million ethnic\nUkrainians.[317] A quarter of the people in the Soviet Union were wounded or\nkilled.[318] Germany sustained 5.3 million military losses, mostly on the\nEastern Front and during the final battles in Germany.[319]\n\nOf the total number of deaths in World War\u00a0II, approximately 85 percent\u2014mostly\nSoviet and Chinese\u2014were on the Allied side and 15 percent were on the Axis\nside. Many of these deaths were caused by war crimes committed by German and\nJapanese forces in occupied territories. An estimated 11[320] to 17\nmillion[321] civilians died either as a direct or as an indirect result of\nNazi ideological policies, including the systematic genocide of around 6\nmillion Jews during the Holocaust, along with a further 5 to 6 million ethnic\nPoles and other Slavs (including Ukrainians and Belarusians)[322]\u2014Roma,\nhomosexuals, and other ethnic and minority groups.[321] Hundreds of thousands\n(varying estimates) of ethnic Serbs, along with gypsies and Jews, were\nmurdered by the Axis-aligned Croatian Usta\u0161e in Yugoslavia,[323] and\nretribution-related killings were committed just after the war ended.\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Chinese_civilians_to_b\ne_buried_alive.jpg/220px-Chinese_civilians_to_be_buried_alive.jpg)\n\nChinese civilians being buried alive by soldiers of the Imperial Japanese\nArmy, during the Nanking Massacre, December 1937\n\nThe best-known Japanese atrocity was the Nanking Massacre, in which several\nhundred thousand Chinese civilians were raped and murdered.[324] Between 3\nmillion and more than 10 million civilians, mostly Chinese (estimated at 7.5\nmillion[325]), were killed by the Japanese occupation forces.[326] Mitsuyoshi\nHimeta reported that 2.7 million casualties occurred during the _Sank\u014d\nSakusen_. General Yasuji Okamura implemented the policy in Heipei and\nShantung.[327]\n\nAxis forces employed biological and chemical weapons. The Imperial Japanese\nArmy used a variety of such weapons during its invasion and occupation of\nChina (_see Unit 731_)[328][329] and in early conflicts against the\nSoviets.[330] Both the Germans and Japanese tested such weapons against\ncivilians[331] and, sometimes on prisoners of war.[332]\n\nThe Soviet Union was responsible for the Katyn massacre of 22,000 Polish\nofficers,[333] and the imprisonment or execution of thousands of political\nprisoners by the NKVD,[334] in the Baltic states, and eastern Poland annexed\nby the Red Army.\n\nThe mass-bombing of civilian areas, notably the cities of Warsaw, Rotterdam\nand London; including the aerial targeting of hospitals and fleeing\nrefugees[335] by the German Luftwaffe, along with the bombing of Tokyo, and\nGerman cities of Dresden, Hamburg and Cologne by the Western Allies may be\nconsidered as war crimes. The latter resulted in the destruction of more than\n160 cities and the death of more than 600,000 German civilians.[336] However,\nno positive or specific customary international humanitarian law with respect\nto aerial warfare existed before or during World War\u00a0II.[337]\n\n### Concentration camps, slave labour, and genocide\n\nFurther information: Genocide, The Holocaust, Nazi concentration camps,\nExtermination camp, Forced labour under German rule during World War II,\nKidnapping of children by Nazi Germany and Nazi human experimentation\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a\n/The_Liberation_of_Bergen-belsen_Concentration_Camp%2C_April_1945_BU4031.jpg\n/220px-The_Liberation_of_Bergen-\nbelsen_Concentration_Camp%2C_April_1945_BU4031.jpg)\n\nFemale SS camp guards remove bodies from lorries and carry them to a mass\ngrave, inside the German Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, 1945\n\nThe German Government led by Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party was responsible\nfor the Holocaust, the killing of approximately 6 million Jews, as well as 2.7\nmillion ethnic Poles,[338] and 4 million others who were deemed \"unworthy of\nlife\" (including the disabled and mentally ill, Soviet prisoners of war,\nhomosexuals, Freemasons, Jehovah's Witnesses, and Romani) as part of a\nprogramme of deliberate extermination. About 12 million, most of whom were\nEastern Europeans, were employed in the German war economy as forced\nlabourers.[339]\n\nIn addition to Nazi concentration camps, the Soviet gulags (labour camps) led\nto the death of citizens of occupied countries such as Poland, Lithuania,\nLatvia, and Estonia, as well as German prisoners of war (POWs) and even Soviet\ncitizens who had been or were thought to be supporters of the Nazis.[340]\nSixty percent of Soviet POWs of the Germans died during the war.[341] Richard\nOvery gives the number of 5.7 million Soviet POWs. Of those, 57 percent died\nor were killed, a total of 3.6\u00a0million.[342] Soviet ex-POWs and repatriated\ncivilians were treated with great suspicion as potential Nazi collaborators,\nand some of them were sent to the Gulag upon being checked by the NKVD.[343]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Czeslawa_Kwoka_-\n_Brasse.jpg/220px-Czeslawa_Kwoka_-_Brasse.jpg)\n\nPrisoner identity photograph taken by the German SS of a fourteen-year-old\nPolish girl, Czes\u0142awa Kwoka, deported as forced labour to Auschwitz, December\n1942\n\nJapanese prisoner-of-war camps, many of which were used as labour camps, also\nhad high death rates. The International Military Tribunal for the Far East\nfound the death rate of Western prisoners was 27.1 percent (for American POWs,\n37 percent),[344] seven times that of POWs under the Germans and\nItalians.[345] While 37,583 prisoners from the UK, 28,500 from the\nNetherlands, and 14,473 from the United States were released after the\nsurrender of Japan, the number of Chinese released was only 56.[346]\n\nAccording to historian Zhifen Ju, at least five million Chinese civilians from\nnorthern China and Manchukuo were enslaved between 1935 and 1941 by the East\nAsia Development Board, or _K\u014dain_, for work in mines and war industries.\nAfter 1942, the number reached 10 million.[347] The US Library of Congress\nestimates that in Java, between 4 and 10 million _romusha_ (Japanese: \"manual\nlaborers\"), were forced to work by the Japanese military. About 270,000 of\nthese Javanese labourers were sent to other Japanese-held areas in South East\nAsia, and only 52,000 were repatriated to Java.[348]\n\nOn 19 February 1942, Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, interning about\n100,000 Japanese living on the West Coast. Canada had a similar\nprogram.[349][350] In addition, 14,000 German and Italian citizens who had\nbeen assessed as being security risks were also interned.[351]\n\nIn accordance with the Allied agreement made at the Yalta Conference millions\nof POWs and civilians were used as forced labour by the Soviet Union.[352] In\nHungary's case, Hungarians were forced to work for the Soviet Union until\n1955.[353]\n\n### Occupation\n\nMain articles: German-occupied Europe, Lebensraum, Untermensch, Collaboration\nwith the Axis Powers during World War II, Resistance during World War II and\nNazi plunder\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Palmiry_before_executi\non.jpg/220px-Palmiry_before_execution.jpg)\n\nPolish civilians with blindfolds photographed just before their execution by\nGerman soldiers in Palmiry, 1940\n\nIn Europe, occupation came under two forms. In Western, Northern and Central\nEurope (France, Norway, Denmark, the Low Countries, and the annexed portions\nof Czechoslovakia) Germany established economic policies through which it\ncollected roughly 69.5 billion reichmarks (27.8 billion US Dollars) by the end\nof the war, this figure does not include the sizeable plunder of industrial\nproducts, military equipment, raw materials and other goods.[354] Thus, the\nincome from occupied nations was over 40 percent of the income Germany\ncollected from taxation, a figure which increased to nearly 40 percent of\ntotal German income as the war went on.[355]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Bundesarchiv_Bild_101I\n-031-2436-03A%2C_Russland%2C_Hinrichtung_von_Partisanen_retouched.jpg/220px-Bu\nndesarchiv_Bild_101I-031-2436-03A%2C_Russland%2C_Hinrichtung_von_Partisanen_re\ntouched.jpg)\n\nThe Russian Academy of Sciences in 1995 reported civilian victims in the USSR\nat German hands totaled 13.7 million dead, 20% of the 68 million persons in\nthe occupied USSR.\n\nIn the East, the much hoped for bounties of _Lebensraum_ were never attained\nas fluctuating front-lines and Soviet scorched earth policies denied resources\nto the German invaders.[356] Unlike in the West, the Nazi racial policy\nencouraged excessive brutality against what it considered to be the \"inferior\npeople\" of Slavic descent; most German advances were thus followed by mass\nexecutions.[357] Although resistance groups formed in most occupied\nterritories, they did not significantly hamper German operations in either the\nEast[358] or the West[359] until late 1943.\n\nIn Asia, Japan termed nations under its occupation as being part of the\nGreater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, essentially a Japanese hegemony which\nit claimed was for purposes of liberating colonised peoples.[360] Although\nJapanese forces were originally welcomed as liberators from European\ndomination in some territories, their excessive brutality turned local public\nopinion against them within weeks.[361] During Japan's initial conquest it\ncaptured 4,000,000 barrels (640,000\u00a0m3) of oil (~5.5\u00d7105 tonnes) left behind\nby retreating Allied forces, and by 1943 was able to get production in the\nDutch East Indies up to 50 million barrels (~6.8\u00d710~~^~~6\u00a0t), 76 percent of\nits 1940 output rate.[361]\n\n### Home fronts and production\n\nMain articles: Military production during World War II and Home front during\nWorld War II\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/WorldWarII-GDP-\nRelations-Allies-Axis-simple.svg/330px-WorldWarII-GDP-Relations-Allies-Axis-\nsimple.svg.png)\n\nAllied to Axis GDP ratio\n\nIn Europe, before the outbreak of the war, the Allies had significant\nadvantages in both population and economics. In 1938, the Western Allies\n(United Kingdom, France, Poland and British Dominions) had a 30 percent larger\npopulation and a 30 percent higher gross domestic product than the European\nAxis (Germany and Italy); if colonies are included, it then gives the Allies\nmore than a 5:1 advantage in population and nearly 2:1 advantage in GDP.[362]\nIn Asia at the same time, China had roughly six times the population of Japan,\nbut only an 89 percent higher GDP; this is reduced to three times the\npopulation and only a 38 percent higher GDP if Japanese colonies are\nincluded.[362]\n\nThough the Allies' economic and population advantages were largely mitigated\nduring the initial rapid blitzkrieg attacks of Germany and Japan, they became\nthe decisive factor by 1942, after the United States and Soviet Union joined\nthe Allies, as the war largely settled into one of attrition.[363] While the\nAllies' ability to out-produce the Axis is often attributed to the Allies\nhaving more access to natural resources, other factors, such as Germany and\nJapan's reluctance to employ women in the labour force,[364] Allied strategic\nbombing,[365] and Germany's late shift to a war economy[366] contributed\nsignificantly. Additionally, neither Germany nor Japan planned to fight a\nprotracted war, and were not equipped to do so.[367] To improve their\nproduction, Germany and Japan used millions of slave labourers;[368] Germany\nused about 12 million people, mostly from Eastern Europe,[339] while Japan\nused more than 18 million people in Far East Asia.[347][348]\n\n### Advances in technology and warfare\n\nMain article: Technology during World War II\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Boeing-Whichata_B-\n29_Assembly_Line_-_1944.jpg/225px-Boeing-Whichata_B-\n29_Assembly_Line_-_1944.jpg)\n\nB-29 Superfortress strategic bombers on the Boeing assembly line in Wichita,\nKansas, 1944\n\nAircraft were used for reconnaissance, as fighters, bombers, and ground-\nsupport, and each role was advanced considerably. Innovation included airlift\n(the capability to quickly move limited high-priority supplies, equipment, and\npersonnel);[369] and of strategic bombing (the bombing of enemy industrial and\npopulation centres to destroy the enemy's ability to wage war).[370] Anti-\naircraft weaponry also advanced, including defences such as radar and surface-\nto-air artillery, such as the German 88 mm gun. The use of the jet aircraft\nwas pioneered and, though late introduction meant it had little impact, it led\nto jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide.[371]\n\nAdvances were made in nearly every aspect of naval warfare, most notably with\naircraft carriers and submarines. Although aeronautical warfare had relatively\nlittle success at the start of the war, actions at Taranto, Pearl Harbor, and\nthe Coral Sea established the carrier as the dominant capital ship in place of\nthe battleship.[372][373][374]\n\nIn the Atlantic, escort carriers proved to be a vital part of Allied convoys,\nincreasing the effective protection radius and helping to close the Mid-\nAtlantic gap.[375] Carriers were also more economical than battleships because\nof the relatively low cost of aircraft[376] and their not requiring to be as\nheavily armoured.[377] Submarines, which had proved to be an effective weapon\nduring the First World War,[378] were anticipated by all sides to be important\nin the second. The British focused development on anti-submarine weaponry and\ntactics, such as sonar and convoys, while Germany focused on improving its\noffensive capability, with designs such as the Type VII submarine and wolfpack\ntactics.[379] Gradually, improving Allied technologies such as the Leigh\nlight, hedgehog, squid, and homing torpedoes proved victorious.\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Bundesarchiv_Bild_141-\n1880%2C_Peenem%C3%BCnde%2C_Start_einer_V2.jpg/200px-\nBundesarchiv_Bild_141-1880%2C_Peenem%C3%BCnde%2C_Start_einer_V2.jpg)\n\nA V-2 rocket launched from a fixed site in Peenem\u00fcnde, 1943\n\nLand warfare changed from the static front lines of World War\u00a0I to increased\nmobility and combined arms. The tank, which had been used predominantly for\ninfantry support in the First World War, had evolved into the primary\nweapon.[380] In the late 1930s, tank design was considerably more advanced\nthan it had been during World War I,[381] and advances continued throughout\nthe war with increases in speed, armour and firepower.\n\nAt the start of the war, most commanders thought enemy tanks should be met by\ntanks with superior specifications.[382] This idea was challenged by the poor\nperformance of the relatively light early tank guns against armour, and German\ndoctrine of avoiding tank-versus-tank combat. This, along with Germany's use\nof combined arms, were among the key elements of their highly successful\nblitzkrieg tactics across Poland and France.[380] Many means of destroying\ntanks, including indirect artillery, anti-tank guns (both towed and self-\npropelled), mines, short-ranged infantry antitank weapons, and other tanks\nwere utilised.[382] Even with large-scale mechanisation, infantry remained the\nbackbone of all forces,[383] and throughout the war, most infantry were\nequipped similarly to World War\u00a0I.[384]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Trinity_device_readied\n.jpg/225px-Trinity_device_readied.jpg)\n\nNuclear _Gadget_ being raised to the top of the detonation tower, at\nAlamogordo Bombing Range; Trinity nuclear test, July 1945\n\nThe portable machine gun spread, a notable example being the German MG34, and\nvarious submachine guns which were suited to close combat in urban and jungle\nsettings.[384] The assault rifle, a late war development incorporating many\nfeatures of the rifle and submachine gun, became the standard postwar infantry\nweapon for most armed forces.[385][386]\n\nMost major belligerents attempted to solve the problems of complexity and\nsecurity involved in using large codebooks for cryptography by designing\nciphering machines, the most well known being the German Enigma machine.[387]\nDevelopment of SIGINT (_sig_nals _int_elligence) and cryptanalysis enabled the\ncountering process of decryption. Notable examples were the Allied decryption\nof Japanese naval codes[388] and British Ultra, a pioneering method for\ndecoding Enigma benefiting from information given to Britain by the Polish\nCipher Bureau, which had been decoding early versions of Enigma before the\nwar.[389] Another aspect of military intelligence was the use of deception,\nwhich the Allies used to great effect, such as in operations Mincemeat and\nBodyguard.[388][390] Other technological and engineering feats achieved\nduring, or as a result of, the war include the world's first programmable\ncomputers (Z3, Colossus, and ENIAC), guided missiles and modern rockets, the\nManhattan Project's development of nuclear weapons, operations research and\nthe development of artificial harbours and oil pipelines under the English\nChannel.[391]\n\n## See also\n\n  * Air warfare of World War II\n  * Bibliography of World War II\n  * Declarations of war during World War II\n  * Home front during World War II\n  * List of World War II battles\n  * List of World War II conferences\n  * List of World War II military operations\n  * Women in World War II\n  * World War II in popular culture\n  * List of World War II films\n\nDocumentaries\n\n_See also List of World War II documentary films_\n\n  * _The World Wars (miniseries)_ The World Wars is a three-part, six hour event miniseries by the History Channel that premiered on Monday, May 26, 2014, (Memorial Day) airing for three consecutive nights.

These all-purpose guns were developed and used by the German army in the 2nd half of World War 2 as a result of studies which showed that the ordinary rifle's long range is much longer than needed, since the soldiers almost always fired at enemies closer than half of its effective range. The assault rifle is a balanced compromise between the rifle and the sub-machine gun, having sufficient range and accuracy to be used as a rifle, combined with the rapid-rate automatic firepower of the sub machine gun. Thanks to these combined advantages, assault rifles such as the American M-16 and the Russian AK-47 are the basic weapon of the modern soldier\u00a0\n  386. **^** Sprague, Oliver; Griffiths, Hugh (2006). \"The AK-47: the worlds favourite killing machine\" (PDF). controlarms.org. p.\u00a01.

Jordan is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the east and south, Iraq to the north-east, Syria to the north, and Israel and Palestine to the west.[5] The country has a strategic location at the crossroads of Asia, Africa and Europe.[6]\n\nInhabited since the Paleolithic period by individual communities, three self-\ngoverned kingdoms later emerged on the territory of modern Jordan at the very\nend of the Bronze Age: Ammon, Moab and Edom.[7] The lands were later part of\nseveral kingdoms and empires, most notably the Nabatean Kingdom, the Roman\nEmpire and finally the Ottoman Empire.[8] After the Partitioning of the\nOttoman Empire after World War I by Britain and France, the Emirate of\nTransjordan was established as a British protectorate and was officially\nrecognized by the Council of the League of Nations in 1922.[9] In 1946, Jordan\nbecame an independent sovereign state officially known as the _Hashemite\nKingdom of Transjordan_. Jordan captured the West Bank during the 1948\nArab\u2013Israeli War and the name of the state was changed to the _Hashemite\nKingdom of Jordan_ on 1 December 1948.[10]\n\nJordan is a small almost landlocked country with a population numbering at 9.5\nmillion.[5] In midst of surrounding turmoil it has been hospitable, accepting\nrefugees from almost all surrounding conflicts as early as 1948, with most\nnotably the estimated 2 million Palestinians and the 1.4 million Syrian\nrefugees residing in the country.[11] Jordan continues to demonstrate\nhospitality, despite the substantial strain the Syrian refugees are holding on\nnational systems and infrastructure.[12] The kingdom is also a refuge to\nthousands of Iraqi Christians fleeing the Islamic State.[13] Jordan is\nconsidered to be among the safest of Arab countries in the Middle East,[14]\nand has managed to keep itself away from terrorism and instability.[15] Jordan\nhas large investments despite having very limited natural resources.[16]\n\nAlthough Jordan is a constitutional monarchy, the king holds wide executive\nand legislative powers.[17] Jordan is classified as a country of \"high human\ndevelopment\" by the 2014 Human Development Report.[4] Jordan has an \"upper\nmiddle income\" economy,[18] and is a major tourist destination in the\nregion,[19] it also attracts medical tourism due to its well developed medical\nsector.[20] Jordan is a founding member of the Arab League and the\nOrganisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).[21] The kingdom is one of two Arab\nstates to have signed a peace treaty with Israel.[22] Sunni Islam is the\ndominant religion in Jordan making about 92% of the country's population along\nwith a Christian minority.[23]\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Etymology\n  * 2 History\n    * 2.1 Ancient period\n    * 2.2 Classical period\n    * 2.3 Islamic era\n    * 2.4 Modern era\n    * 2.5 Post-independence\n  * 3 Geography\n    * 3.1 Climate\n  * 4 Politics and government\n    * 4.1 Foreign relations\n    * 4.2 Military\n    * 4.3 Crime and law enforcement\n  * 5 Economy\n    * 5.1 Industry\n    * 5.2 Tourism\n    * 5.3 Natural resources\n    * 5.4 Transportation\n    * 5.5 Science and technology\n  * 6 Demographics\n    * 6.1 Immigrants and refugees\n    * 6.2 Religion\n    * 6.3 Languages\n  * 7 Culture\n    * 7.1 Arts\n    * 7.2 Sports\n    * 7.3 Cuisine\n  * 8 Health\n  * 9 Education\n  * 10 See also\n  * 11 References\n  * 12 Further reading\n  * 13 External links\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\nThe kingdom is named after the Jordan River, the origin of the river's name is\nargued but the most usual explanation is it is from Hebrew or related Semitic\nlanguages word \"yarad\" meaning \"the descender\" (\"Yarden\" is the Hebrew name\nfor the river), another is that it is from the Arabic root word \"wrd\" meaning\n\"to come to\" (as in people coming to a major source of water).[24] The name\nJordan appears in an ancient Egyptian papyrus called Papyrus Anastasi I,\ndating back to around 1000 BC.[25] The lands consisting of modern-day Jordan\nwere historically called Transjordan, meaning beyond the Jordan River. During\nthe crusader rule of Jordan, it was called Oultrejordain. The name was later\nArabized into \"Al-Urdun\". In 1921, the Emirate of Transjordan was established\nand after it gained its independence, it became the \"Hashemite Kingdom of\nJordan\" in 1948. \"Hashemite\" comes from the house name of the royal\nfamily.[26]\n\n## History[edit]\n\nMain article: History of Jordan\n\n### Ancient period[edit]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/20100923_amman37.JPG\n/220px-20100923_amman37.JPG)\n\nOne of the oldest human statues ever made by human civilization from 'Ain\nGhazal on display at the Jordan Archaeological Museum, dating to about 7000\nBC.[27]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Louvre_042010_01.jpg\n/220px-Louvre_042010_01.jpg)\n\nThe Mesha Stele recorded the glory of Mesha the king of Moab, and his victory\nover the Israelites around 1000 BC on display at the French Louvre museum.\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Edom-Moab-830BCE.svg\n/200px-Edom-Moab-830BCE.svg.png)\n\nKingdoms of Ammon, Edom and Moab in the 9th century BCE.\n\nJordan is rich in Paleolithic remains with evidence of human inhabitance by\nHomo erectus, Neanderthal and later modern humans.[28] The Kharanah area in\neastern Jordan has evidence of human huts from about 20,000 years ago,\nhowever, much older evidence also exist.[29] Other Paleolithic sites include;\nPella and Al-Azraq.[30] In the Neolithic period, several settlements began to\ndevelop, most notably an agricultural community called 'Ain Ghazal in\nAmman.[31] 'Ain Ghazal is one of the largest known prehistoric settlements in\nthe Near East,[32] and is believed to have had a population of 3,000 at its\nheight.[33] In 1984, plaster statues estimated to date back to around 7000 BC\nwere uncovered there and are among the oldest large human statues ever\nfound.[34] Villages of Bab edh-Dhra in the Dead Sea area, Tal Hujayrat Al-\nGhuzlan in Aqaba and Tulaylet Ghassul in the Jordan Valley all date to the\nChalcolithic period.[35]\n\nThe prehistoric period of Jordan ended by 2000 BC when the Semitic nomads\nknown as the Amorites had entered the region. During the Bronze Age and Iron\nAge, present-day Jordan was home to several ancient kingdoms, whose\npopulations spoke Semitic languages of the Canaanite group.[36] Among them\nwere Ammon, Edom and Moab which are described as tribal kingdoms rather than\nstates. They are mentioned on ancient maps, Near Eastern documents, ancient\nGreco-Roman artifacts, and Jewish and Christian religious scriptures.[7]\nAncient texts and archaeology, including the Old Testament reveal that Ammon\nwas in the area including the modern city of Amman, Moab controlled the\nhighlands east of the Dead Sea and Edom controlled the area around Wadi Araba.\nThese Transjordanian kingdoms were in continuos conflict with the neighboring\nHebrew Kingdom of Israel and the Kingdom of Judah, west of the Jordan River.\nThis lead to frequent confrontations which increased tensions between them.\nThis made the Assyrians reduce these kingdoms to vassals. However, when the\nregion was later under the influence of the Babyloanians, the old testament\nmentions that these kingdoms aided them in the 597 BC sack of Jerusalem.[37]\nThe Mesha Stele is a large black basalt stone that was erected in Moab and was\ninscribed by Moabite king Mesha, in which he lauds himself for the building\nprojects that he initiated in Moab and commemorates his glory and victory\nagainst the Israelites.[38] The stele contains the earliest mention of the\nancient kingdom of Israel and constitutes one of the most important direct\naccounts of biblical history.[39]\n\nThese kingdoms are believed to have continued to exist despite the\nfluctuations in the regional imperial rule and influence. They remained under\nrule of several powerful distant empires, including the Akkadian Empire\n(2335\u20132193 BC), Ancient Egypt (15th to 13th centuries BC), Hittite Empire\n(14th and 13th centuries BC), the Middle Assyrian Empire (1365\u20131020 BC), Neo-\nAssyrian Empire (911\u2013605 BC), the Neo-Babylonian Empire (604\u2013539 BC),\nAchaemenid Empire (539\u2013332 BC) and under the Hellenistic Empire of\nMaceodnia.[8] However, by the time of the Roman rule in the Levant around 63\nBC, the people of Ammon, Edom and Moab have lost their ancient identities and\nwere assimilated in the Roman culture.[7]\n\n### Classical period[edit]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Petra_Jordan_BW_21.JPG\n/200px-Petra_Jordan_BW_21.JPG)\n\nAl-Khazneh in the Arab Nabatean city of Petra in southern Jordan, established\npossibly as early as 312 BC, is one of the New7Wonders of the World.\n\nAlexander the Great's conquest of the Archaemenid Empire in 332 BC introduced\nHellenistic culture to the Middle East. After Alexander's death in 323 BC, his\nempire split among his generals and much of the land of modern-day Jordan was\ndisputed between the Ptolemies based in Egypt and the Seleucids based in\nSyria.[40] However, in the south and east the Nabateans had an independent\nkingdom.[41] The Nabateans established Petra as their capital; famed now for\nthe massive buildings carved into the cliff sides. The Ptolemies were\ndisplaced from all this region by the Seleucids, the conflict between these\ntwo groups had enabled the Arab Nabateans to extend their kingdom northwards\nwell beyond Petra in Edom. The Nabateans and Edomites coexisted.[42] The\nGreeks founded new cities in Jordan including Philadelphia (Amman), Gerasa\n(Jerash), Gedara (Umm Qays), Pella (Tabaqat Fahl) and Arbila (Irbid). Later,\nunder Roman rule, these joined other Hellenistic cities in Palestine and Syria\nto form the Decapolis League, a loose confederation linked by bonds of\neconomic and cultural interests: Scythopolis, Hippos, Capitolias, Canatha and\nDamascus were counted among its members.[40] The most notable Hellenistic site\nin Jordan is at Iraq Al-Amir, just west of modern-day Amman. The Qasr Al-Abd\n(Castle of the Slave) there is constructed of very large stones. The castle\nbelonged to a governor of Ammon named Hyrcanus, a member of the influential\nTobiad family. It was built in the late-second century BCE.[8]\n\nRoman legions under Pompey conquered much of the Levant in 63 BC, inaugurating\na period of Roman rule that lasted for centuries.[8] In 106 AD, Emperor Trajan\nannexed the nearby Nabatean kingdom and built the Via Traiana Nova road, in\nwhich Amman became a point along a road stretching from Aqaba to Damascus.\nThis provided an economic boost for the region.[43] Despite the Roman rule,\nthe Nabateans continued to flourish and replaced their local gods with\nChristianity.[44] Roman remains include, in Amman, the Temple of Hercules at\nthe Amman Citadel, the Roman amphitheater, the Odeon theater and the\nNymphaeum. Jerash also has a very well-preserved Roman city that had an\ninhabitance of 15,000 at its height.[45] Jerash was once visited by Emperor\nHadrian himself during his journey to Palestine.[44] In 324 AD, the Roman\nEmpire split but the Eastern Roman Empire (later known as the Byzantine\nEmpire) continued to control or influence the Jordan region until 636 AD.\nChristianity had become legal within the empire in 313 AD and the official\nstate religion in 390 AD, after Emperor Constantine converted to\nChristianity.[44] Ayla city (modern day Aqaba) in southern Jordan, also came\nunder Byzantine Empire rule, where the world's first purpose built church was\nconstructed around 300 AD.[46] The Byzantines built 16 historic churches just\nsouth of Amman in Umm ar-Rasas.[47] Administratively the area of Jordan was in\nthe provinces of Palaestina Secunda in the north-west and Arabia Petraea in\nthe south and east in the Diocese of the East. Palaestina Salutaris in the\nsouth was split off from Arabia Petraea in the late 4th century. The Sassanian\nEmpire was to the east and at times controlled part of the region and was\nalways a threat.\n\n### Islamic era[edit]\n\nMain article: Jund al-Urdunn\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Jerash_Oval_Plaza.jpg\n/220px-Jerash_Oval_Plaza.jpg)\n\nThe Roman Oval Piazza in the ancient city of Jerash in northern Jordan, which\nwas established in the first century AD.\n\nThe Arab Christian Ghassanids in the Levant, who were clients of the\nByzantines, could not hold back the Muslim onslaught from the Arabian\nPeninsula even with the imperial support.[48] The Muslim conquest began to\nsweep northwards from modern day Saudi Arabia, reaching Jordan when the Muslim\nforces lost to the Byzantines during the 629 Battle of Mu'tah in Karak\nGovernorate of Jordan, this battle was the first engagement between the\nByzantines and the Muslims. However, the Byzantines lost control of the Levant\nwhen they were defeated by the Muslim Rashidun army in the 636 decisive Battle\nof Yarmouk just north of modern day Jordan.[44] Transjordan was an essential\nterritory for the conquest of nearby Damascus.[49] The first, or Rashidun\ncaliphate was followed by those of the Ummayad (661\u2013750). During the rule of\nthe Umayyads, several desert castles were constructed such as; Qasr Mshatta,\nQasr al-Hallabat, Qasr Kharana, Qasr Tuba, and Qusayr 'Amra, and a large\nadministrative palace in Amman.[50] The Abbasid campaign to take over the\nUmayyad empire began in region of Transjordan. After the decline of the\nAbbasid Caliphate, the area was ruled by the Fatimids, then by the Crusader\nKingdom of Jerusalem (1115\u20131189).[49]\n\nThe Crusaders constructed about nine Crusader castles as part of the lordship\nof Oultrejordain, including those of Montreal (Shawbak), Karak and Li Vaux\nMoyse (Wu'ayra).[50] In the 12th century, Transjordan became a battlefield for\nthe Crusaders which ended with their defeat by Saladin, the founder of the\nAyyubids dynasty (1189\u20131260). The Ayyubids built a new castle at Ajlun and\nrebuilt the former Roman fort of Qasr Azraq. Several of these castles were\nexpanded and used by the Mamluks (1260-1516). During the next century\nTransjordan also experienced Mongol attacks, but the Mongols were ultimately\nrepelled by the Mamluks after the Battle of Ain Jalut (1260). The Mamluks\ndivided Jordan between the provinces of Karak and Damascus.[50] In 1516,\nOttoman forces invaded the levant and clashed with the Mamluks. The war ended\nin the defeat of the Mamluks and the annexation of the levant to the Ottoman\nEmpire. Jordan lied in between Mecca and Istanbul, and so when the Ottomans\nconstructed the Hejaz Railway linking these two in 1910, Jordan's importance\nincreased. The railway was mainly used for the transportation of pilgrims to\nMecca.[51] The Ottoman empire ruled until 1918.[49]\n\n### Modern era[edit]\n\nMain articles: Battle of Aqaba and Emirate of Transjordan\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/030Arab.jpg/220px-\n030Arab.jpg)\n\nSoldiers of the Arab Army holding the flag of the Great Arab Revolt in 1916\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/The_high_commissioner%\n27s_first_visit_to_Transjordan%2C_in_Es-Salt..jpg/220px-\nThe_high_commissioner%27s_first_visit_to_Transjordan%2C_in_Es-Salt..jpg)\n\nFirst visit of the high commissioner of Palestine to Al-Salt city in\nTransjordan in 1920.\n\nAfter four centuries of stagnant Ottoman rule (1516\u20131918), Turkish control\nover Transjordan came to an end during World War I when the Hashemite Army of\nthe Great Arab Revolt, in alliance with the British, took over and secured\npresent-day Jordan with the help and support of Transjordanian local tribes,\nCircassians and Jordanian Christians.[52] The revolt was launched by the\nHashemites and led by Sherif Hussein of Mecca against the Ottoman Empire. This\ncame due to Arab resentment for the Ottomans who neglected the areas in the\nLevant that they had governed and often abused.[53] The revolt was supported\nby the Allies of World War\u00a0I including Britain and France.[54]\n\nThe Great Arab Revolt was successful in gaining independence for most of the\nterritories of the Hejaz and the Levant, including the region east of the\nRiver Jordan. However, it failed to gain international recognition of the\nregion as an independent state, due mainly to the secret Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement\nof 1916 and the Balfour Declaration of 1917. This was seen by the Hashemites\nand the Arabs as a betrayal of their previous agreements with the British,\nincluding the McMahon\u2013Hussein Correspondence of 1915, in which the British\nstated their willingness to recognize the independence of a unified Arab state\nin the Hejaz and the Levant under the rule of the Hashemites. However, the\nregion was divided and the four sons of Sharif Hussein were handed the rule of\nthe four newly established states. The emirate's rule was handed to the\nSharif's son King Abdullah I (then Emir) in 1921.[55]\n\nIn September 1922, the Council of the League of Nations recognized Transjordan\nas a state under the British Mandate for Palestine and the Transjordan\nmemorandum, and excluded the territories east of the Jordan River from the\nprovisions of the mandate dealing with Jewish settlement.[56] The Permanent\nCourt of International Justice and an International Court of Arbitration\nestablished by the Council of the League of Nations handed down rulings in\n1925 which determined that Palestine and Transjordan were newly created\nsuccessor states of the Ottoman Empire whose sovereignty was in abeyance until\nsuch time as they would be recognised as independent of the Mandatory.\nTransjordan was established as a British protectorate and remained under\nBritish supervision until 1946.[9]\n\nThe Hashemite leadership met multiple difficulties upon assuming power in the\nregion. The most serious threats to Emir Abdullah's position in Transjordan\nwere repeated Wahhabi incursions from Najd into southern parts of his\nterritory.[57] The emir was unable to repel those raids without the support of\nlocal Bedouin tribes and the British which maintained a military base, with a\nsmall RAF detachment, at Marka, close to Amman.[57] The British force was also\nused to help the emir suppress local rebellions at Kura in 1921 and 1923.[57]\n\n### Post-independence[edit]\n\nMain article: Timeline of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan\n\nThe Treaty of London was signed by the British Government and the Emir of\nTransjordan on 22 March 1946 as a mechanism to recognise the full independence\nof Transjordan upon ratification by both countries parliaments.[58] On 25 May\n1946 the Emirate of Transjordan became the \"Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan\"\nwhen the ruling 'Amir' was re-designated as 'King' by the parliament of\nTransjordan on the day it ratified the Treaty of London. 25 May is still\ncelebrated as independence day in Jordan although officially the mandate for\nTransjordan ended on 17 June 1946 when the in accordance with the Treaty of\nLondon the ratifications were exchanged in Amman and Transjordan gained full\nindependence.[59] The name was changed to \"Hashemite Kingdom of the Jordan\" in\n1949. However, Jordan was not a full member of the United Nations until 14\nDecember 1955.[60]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Karama_aftermath_1.jpg\n/220px-Karama_aftermath_1.jpg)\n\nKing Hussein after checking an abandoned Israeli tank in the aftermath of the\nBattle of Karameh in 1968.\n\nOn 15 May 1948, as part of the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War, Jordan invaded Palestine\ntogether with other Arab states.[61] Following the war, Jordan occupied the\nWest Bank and on 24 April 1950 Jordan formally annexed these territories, an\nact that was regarded as illegal and void by the Arab League. At the Jericho\nConference on 1 December 1948, Palestinian delegates supported \"the\nunification of Palestine and Transjordan as a step toward full Arab\nunity\".[62] The move formed part of Jordan's expansionist policy, the \"Greater\nSyria Plan\",[63] and in response some Arab countries demanded Jordan's\nexpulsion from the Arab League.[64][65] The expulsion was prevented by the\ndissenting votes of Yemen and Iraq.[66] On 12 June 1950, the Arab League\ndeclared the annexation was a temporary, practical measure and that Jordan was\nholding the territory as a \"trustee\" pending a future settlement.[67][68]\n\nKing Abdullah was assassinated by a Palestinian militant at the Al-Aqsa Mosque\nin 1951 and was succeeded by his son Talal. However, the latter abdicated the\nthrone due to illness in favor of his eldest son Hussein, who ascended the\nthrone in 1953.[69] On 1 March 1956, King Hussein sacked the British personnel\nserving in the Jordanian Army and terminated the Anglo-Jordanian treaty a year\nlater. This act of Arabization ensured the complete sovereignty of Jordan as a\nfully independent nation.[70] The decision came after King Hussein saw that\nthe British had dominated all the highest positions in the army, leaving\nnothing to the Jordanians. The decision also aimed to reduce the amount of\nBritish influence on Jordan. John Bagot Glubb commander of the Arab Legion\nalong with several other British personnel left Jordan immediately the day\nafter. The decision received wide echo and recognition especially from Arab\ncountries. As a result, Jordan's relations with the west were damaged and its\nrelations with Arab countries improved.[71]\n\nJordan signed a military pact with Egypt just before Israel launched a\npreemptive strike on Egypt to begin the Six-Day War on June 1967, Jordan and\nSyria joined the war. It ended in an Israeli victory and the capture of the\nWest Bank. Jordan also had another war; War of Attrition, which included the\n1968 Battle of Karameh where the combined forces of the Jordanian Army and the\nPalestine Liberation Organization repelled an Israeli attack on the Karameh\ncamp on the Jordanian border with West Bank.[72] Later, there was an upsurge\nin the development of Palestinian paramilitary elements (_fedayeen_) within\nJordan. These armed militias were becoming a \"state within a state\", which\nthreatened Jordan's rule of law. Jordanian Armed Forces targeted the\n_fedayeen_ and fighting erupted in June 1970. Known as the Black September in\nwhich Palestinian fighters from various Palestine Liberation Organization\n(PLO) groups were expelled from Jordan into Lebanon.[22]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/P%C3%A9tra_24.jpg/170p\nx-P%C3%A9tra_24.jpg)\n\nJordanian Bedouin forces officer in Petra 2004.\n\nDuring the Yom Kippur War in 1973, Arab league forces waged a war on Israel\nand fighting occurred along the 1967 Jordan River cease-fire line. Jordan sent\na brigade to Syria to attack Israeli units on Syrian territory but did not\nengage Israeli forces from Jordanian territory. At the Rabat summit conference\nin 1974, Jordan agreed, along with the rest of the Arab League, that the\nPalestinian Liberation Organization was the \"sole legitimate representative of\nthe Palestinian people\". Subsequently, Jordan renounced it claims to the West\nBank in 1988.[22]\n\nAt the 1991 Madrid Conference, Jordan agreed to negotiate on a peace treaty\nsponsored by the US and the Soviet Union. It negotiated an end to hostilities\nwith Israel and signed a declaration known as the Israeli-Jordanian peace\ntreaty 26 October 1994.[22] In 1997, Israeli agents allegedly entered Jordan\nusing Canadian passports and poisoned Khaled Meshal, a senior Hamas leader.\nIsrael provided an antidote to the poison and released dozens of political\nprisoners, including Sheikh Ahmed Yassin after King Hussein threatened to cut\nrelations with Israel.[22]\n\nOn 7 February 1999, King Abdullah II ascended the throne upon the death of his\nfather Hussein. Hussein had recently named him Crown Prince on 24 January,\nreplacing Hussein's brother Hassan.[73] Jordan's economy has improved since\nAbdullah II ascended to the throne in 1999. He has been credited with\nincreasing foreign investment, improving public-private partnerships and\nproviding the foundation for Aqaba's free-trade zone and Jordan's flourishing\ninformation and communication technology (ICT) sector. He also set up five\nother special economic zones: Irbid, Ajloun, Mafraq, Ma'an, and the Dead Sea.\nAs a result of these reforms, Jordan's economic growth has doubled to 6%\nannually under Abdullah II's rule compared to the latter half of the\n1990s.[74] Direct foreign investment from the West as well as from the\ncountries of the Persian Gulf has continued to increase.[75] He also\nnegotiated a free-trade agreement with the United States, which was the third\nfree trade agreement for the U.S. and the first with an Arab country.[76] His\nefforts has turned Jordan into the freest Arab economy and the 9th freest\neconomy in the world according to an 2015 study issued by the Friedrich\nNaumann Foundation for Liberty.[77] However, regional turmoil in the 2010s has\nseverely crippled the Jordanian economy and made it increasingly reliant on\nforeign aid.[78]\n\nAl-Qaeda under Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's leadership launched coordinated\nexplosions in three hotel lobbies in Amman on 9 November 2005, resulting in 60\ndeaths and 115 injured. The bombings, which targeted civilians, caused\nwidespread outrage among Jordanians.[79] The attack is considered to be a rare\nevent in the country, Jordan's security as a whole was dramatically improved\nafterwards. No major terrorist attacks have been reported since then.[15]\n\nThe Arab Spring began sweeping the Arab world in 2011, where large scale\nprotests erupted demanding economic and political reforms. However, many of\nthese protests in some countries turned into civil wars and more instability.\nIn Jordan, Abdullah II replaced his prime minister and formed a National\nDialogue Commission with a reform mandate in response to domestic unrest on 1\nFebruary 2011. The King told the new prime minister to \"take quick, concrete\nand practical steps to launch a genuine political reform process, to\nstrengthen democracy and provide Jordanians with the dignified life they\ndeserve.\"[80] The King called for an \"immediate revision\" of laws governing\npolitics and public freedoms.[81]\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\nMain article: Geography of Jordan\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Mountain_in_Wadi_Rum%2\nC_Jordan.jpg/220px-Mountain_in_Wadi_Rum%2C_Jordan.jpg)\n\nWadi Rum's resemblance to the surface of Mars has made it a popular filming\nlocation, including scenes in The Martian.\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Dead_sea_newspaper.jpg\n/220px-Dead_sea_newspaper.jpg)\n\nThe Dead Sea is the saltiest water body and the lowest point on earth,\nswimmers can float effortlessly while receiving health benefits.\n\nJordan sits at the crossroads of the continents of Asia, Africa and Europe.[6]\nThe country is 89,341 km2 (34,495\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) large and is 400\u00a0km (250\u00a0mi) long\nbetween its northernmost and southernmost points; Umm Qais and Aqaba\nrespectively.[82] The kingdom lies on the continent of Asia between latitudes\n29\u00b0 and 34\u00b0 N, and longitudes 34\u00b0 and 40\u00b0 E (a small area lies west of 35\u00b0).\nIn the east is an arid plateau irrigated by oasis and seasonal water streams.\nIn the west a highland area of arable land and Mediterranean evergreen\nforestry drops suddenly into the Jordan Rift Valley The rift valley contains\nthe Jordan River and the Dead Sea which separate Jordan from Israel and the\nPalestinian Territories. The country has a 26\u00a0km (16\u00a0mi) shoreline on the Gulf\nof Aqaba in the Red Sea starting at the southern tip of the Arabah (the\nextension of the rift valley south of the Dead Sea) but is otherwise\nlandlocked.[82] The Yarmouk River, an eastern tributary of the Jordan, forms\npart of the boundary between Jordan and Syria (including the occupied Golan\nHeights) to the north. The other boundaries are formed by several\ninternational and local agreements and do not follow any well-defined natural\nfeatures.[83] The highest point in the country is Jabal Umm al Dami, at 1,854\nm (6,083\u00a0ft) above sea level, while the lowest is the Dead Sea \u2212420\u00a0m (\u22121,378\nft) (also the lowest land point on earth). Jordan is one of the countries of\nthe Levant which is part of the Fertile Crescent, a cradle of\ncivilization.[83]\n\nForests cover less than 2% of Jordan, making it among the world's least\nforested countries, with the internationally accepted average of 15%. The 2%\namounts to 1.5 million dunums (1,500\u00a0km2). However, the green cover in Jordan\nis currently on the rise.[84] Ten major dams play a large role in providing\nJordan's need for fresh water.[85] Jordan has multiple ecosystems and biota\ndue to its diverse landscapes and environments.[86]\n\nMajor cities are overwhelmingly located on the north-western part of the\nkingdom due to its fertile soils and relatively abundant rainfall which\nincludes the capital Amman and Al-Salt in the west, Irbid, Jerash and Zarqa,\nin the northwest and Madaba, Karak and Aqaba in the southwest.[5] Major towns\nin the eastern part of the country are the oasis town of Azraq and\nRuwaished.[83]\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\nMain article: Climate of Jordan\n\nThe climate in Jordan ranges greatly.[87] It is hot and sunny in summer with\naverage temperature in the mid 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) and is relatively cool in winter\naveraging around 13\u00a0\u00b0C (55\u00a0\u00b0F) with frequent showers and occasional snowfall\nin some elevated areas. The western part of the country receives greater\nprecipitation during the winter season from November to March and snowfall in\nAmman (756\u00a0m (2,480\u00a0ft) ~ 1,280\u00a0m (4,199\u00a0ft) above sea level) and Western\nHeights of 500\u00a0m (1,640\u00a0ft). Excluding the rift valley, the rest of the\ncountry is entirely above 300\u00a0m (984\u00a0ft) (SL). Although the desert parts of\nthe kingdom reach high temperatures, the heat is usually moderated by low\nhumidity and a daytime breeze while the nights are cool and pleasant.[5] The\nweather is humid from November to March and semi dry for the rest of the year.\nWith hot, dry summers and cool winters during which practically all of the\nprecipitation occurs, the country has a Mediterranean-style climate. In\ngeneral, the further inland from the Mediterranean a given part of the country\nlies, the greater are the seasonal contrasts in temperature and the less\nrainfall.[88]\n\n## Politics and government[edit]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Jordan_governorates_na\nmed_regions.svg/200px-Jordan_governorates_named_regions.svg.png)\n\nJordan is divided into 12 governorates (_muhafazah_). Clickable map for\nindividual governorates.\n\nMain article: Politics of Jordan\n\nAlthough Jordan is a constitutional monarchy, the king holds wide executive\nand legislative powers. He serves as Head of State and Commander-in-Chief and\nappoints the executive branch consisting of the Prime Minister and governors\nof the individual governorates. The prime minister is then free to choose his\nown cabinet, generally from the legislative body.[17] The king's jurisdictions\ninclude; dissolving the parliament and dismissing the government.[89] The\ncurrent king, King Abdullah II, ascended the throne in February 1999 after the\ndeath of his father King Hussein. Abdullah reaffirmed Jordan's commitment to\nthe peace treaty with Israel and its relations with the United States. He\nrefocused the government's agenda on economic reform, during his first year.\nKing Abdullah's son prince Hussein is the current crown prince of Jordan.[90]\nThe current prime minister is Abdullah Ensour who received his position on 3\nMarch 2013.[91]\n\nJordan is divided into 12 governorates (muhafazah) (informally grouped into\nthree regions: Northern, Central, Southern), these are subdivided into a total\nof 52 subdivisions called nawahi which are further divided into neighborhoods\nin urban areas or into towns in rural ones.[92] The Parliament of Jordan\nconsists of two chambers: the House of Representatives (_Majlis Al-Nuwab_) and\nthe Senate (_Majlis Al-'Aayan_). All 75 members of the Senate are directly\nappointed by the King, they are usually veteran politicians or are known to\nhave held previous positions in the House of Representatives or in the\ngovernment.[93] Of the 130 members of the House of Representatives, 108 are\nelected from the 12 governorates while 27 seats are chosen through\nproportional representation on nationwide party lists in a 4-year election\ncycle.[94] Minimum quotas exist in the House for women (15 seats,[94] though\nthey won 19 seats in the 2013 election)[95] and Jordanian Christians (9\nseats). Jordan has multiple political parties though they contest fewer than a\nfifth of the seats; the remainder belong to independent politicians.[96] The\ngovernment can also be dismissed by a two-thirds vote of \"no confidence\" by\nthe House of Representatives. A new law enacted in July 2012 placed political\nparties under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Interior and forbade the\nestablishment of parties based on religion.[97]\n\nThe Constitution of Jordan was adopted on 11 January 1952 and has been amended\na number of times, most recently in 2014.[98] Article 97 of Jordan's\nconstitution guarantees the independence of the judicial branch, clearly\nstating that judges are 'subject to no authority but that of the law.' While\nthe king must approve the appointment and dismissal of judges, in practice\nthese are supervised by the Higher Judicial Council. Article 99 of the\nConstitution divides the courts into three categories: civil, religious, and\nspecial. The civil courts deal with civil and criminal matters in accordance\nwith the law, and they have jurisdiction over all persons in all matters,\ncivil and criminal, including cases brought against the government. The civil\ncourts include Magistrate Courts, Courts of First Instance, Courts of\nAppeal,[99] High Administrative Courts which hear cases relating to\nadministrative matters,[100] and the Constitutional Court which was set up in\n2012 in order to hear cases regarding the constitutionality of laws.[101] The\nreligious court system's jurisdiction extends to matters of personal status\nsuch as divorce and inheritance [102] The special court deals with cases\nforwarded by the civil one.[103]\n\nJordan had the 5th freest press of 19 countries in the Middle East and North\nAfrica region. In the 2014 Press Freedom Index maintained by Reporters Without\nBorders, Jordan ranked 141st out of 180 countries listed, 10th out of the 20\ncountries in the Middle East and North Africa region. Jordan's score was 70 on\na scale from 0 (most free) to 105 (least free). The report added \"the Arab\nSpring and the Syrian conflict have led the authorities to tighten their grip\non the media and, in particular, the Internet, despite an outcry from civil\nsociety\".[104] Jordanian media consists of public and private institutions,\npopular Jordanian newspapers include; Ammon News, Ad-Dustour and Jordan Times.\nWhile the most two watched TV stations are Ro'ya TV and Jordan TV.

During the first Gulf\nWar, these relations were damaged by Jordan's neutrality and maintaining\nrelations with Iraq. Later, Jordan restored its relations with Western\ncountries through its participation in the enforcement of UN sanctions against\nIraq and in the Southwest Asia peace process. After King Hussein's death in\n1999, relations between Jordan and the Persian Gulf countries greatly\nimproved.[106]\n\nJordan is a key ally of the USA and UK and, together with Egypt, is one of\nonly two Arab nations to have signed peace treaties with Israel.[107][108]\nAfter Jordan agreed to the treaty in 1994, the United States not only\ncontributes hundreds of millions of dollars in an annual foreign aid to\nJordan, but also has allowed it to establish a free trade zone in which to\nmanufacture goods that will enter the US without paying the usual import taxes\nas long as a percentage of the material used in them is purchased in\nIsrael.[22] In Israel in 2009, several Likud lawmakers proposed a bill that\ncalled for a Palestinian state on both sides of the Jordan River, presuming\nthat Jordan should be the alternative homeland for the Palestinians. Later,\nthe Israeli Foreign Ministry disavowed the original proposal.[109] Jordan\nsupports Palestinian demand for statehood and independence.[110] The Hashemite\nfamily has had custodianship over holy sites in Jerusalem ever since the\nbeginning of the 20th century, this is also stressed in the Jordan-Israel\npeace treaty. Turmoil in Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem between Israelis and\nPalestinians has initiated tensions between Jordan and Israel, concerning the\nformer's role in protecting the Muslim and Christian sites in Jerusalem.[111]\n\nJordan is a founding member of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and of\nthe Arab League.[21][112] Jordan enjoys \"advanced status\" with the European\nUnion since December 2010 and is part of the European Neighbourhood Policy\n(ENP) which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer.[113] Jordan and\nMorocco tried to join the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in 2011, but the gulf\ncountries offered a five-year development aid programme instead.[114]\n\n### Military[edit]\n\nMain article: Jordanian Armed Forces\n\nSee also: List of wars involving Jordan\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/A_Jordanian_Armed_Forc\nes_sentry%2C_foreground%2C_secures_the_area_while_his_team_extracts_simulated_\ninjured_aircrewmen_from_the_area_behind_him_during_exercise_Eagle_Resolve_2013\n_in_Doha%2C_Qatar%2C_April_30%2C_2013_130430-F-VT324-064.jpg/220px-\nthumbnail.jpg)\n\nJordanian soldier during a military exercise\n\nFirst organized army in Jordan was established on 22 October 1920, and was\nnamed the \"Mobile Force\", at the time it was 150 men strong. It was later\nrenamed into the \"Arab Legion\" which numbered some 8,000 soldiers in 3\nmechanized regiments. Jordan's capture of the West Bank during the 1948 Arab-\nIsraeli War proved that the Arab Legion, known today as the Jordan Armed\nForces was the most effective among the Arab troops involved in the war.[115]\nThe Jordanian army today is considered to be among the most professional in\nthe region, and is seen as particularly well-trained and organized.[116] The\nJordanian military enjoys strong support and aid from the United States, the\nUnited Kingdom and France. This is due to the country's critical position\nbetween Israel, the West Bank, Syria, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia, with very close\nproximity to Lebanon and Egypt. The development of the Special Operations\nForces has been particularly significant, enhancing the capability of the\nforces to react rapidly to threats to state security, as well as training\nspecial forces from the region and beyond.[117]\n\nThere are about 50,000 Jordanian troops working with the United Nations in\npeacekeeping missions across the world. These soldiers provide everything from\nmilitary defense and training of native police, to medical care and\nhumanitarian aid. Jordan ranks third internationally in participating in U.N.\npeacekeeping missions,[118] with one of the highest levels of peacekeeping\ntroop contributions of all U.N. member states.[119][120]\n\nJordan has dispatched several field hospitals to conflict zones and areas\naffected by natural disasters across the world such as Iraq, the West Bank,\nLebanon, Afghanistan, Haiti, Indonesia, Congo, Liberia, Ethiopia, Eritrea,\nSierra Leone and Pakistan. The Kingdom's field hospitals extended aid to more\nthan one million people in Iraq, some one million in the West Bank and 55,000\nin Lebanon. According to the military, there are Jordanian peacekeeping forces\nin Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America. Jordanian Armed Forces field\nhospital in Afghanistan has since 2002 provided assistance to thousands of\npatients.[121] Jordan also provides extensive training of security forces in\nIraq,[122] the Palestinian territories,[123] and the GCC.[124]\n\nIn 2014, Jordan joined an aerial bombardment campaign by an international\ncoalition lead by the United States against the Islamic State as part of its\nintervention in the Syrian Civil War.[125] In 2015, Jordan participated in the\nSaudi Arabian-led military intervention in Yemen against the Shia Houthis and\nforces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was deposed in the\n2011 uprising.[126]\n\n### Crime and law enforcement[edit]\n\nMain article: Law enforcement in Jordan\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Female_police_officer_\nin_Amman.JPG/220px-Female_police_officer_in_Amman.JPG)\n\nA Female police officer in Amman\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Jordanian_Police_autom\nobile_%28Audi%29.JPG/220px-Jordanian_Police_automobile_%28Audi%29.JPG)\n\nAn Amman City Centre Police Vehicle\n\nJordan's law enforcement is the purview of the \"Public Security Department\"\n(which includes approximately 40,000 persons). The Jordanian national police,\nis subordinate to the Public Security Directorate of the Ministry of Interior.\nThe first police force in the Jordanian state, after the fall of the Ottoman\nEmpire was organized on 11 April 1921. Ali Khulqi Pasha Alsharairi was\nappointed as the first commander of the security force and as a National\nSecurity Counsellor (minister) in the first Transjordan government. The first\nsecurity force was composed of the Gendarmerie Battalion, and the Gendarmerie\nregiment, the reservist regiment, the regulars, and the desert patrol\nforce.[127] Until 1956 the police duties were carried totally by the Arab\nLegion and the Transjordan Frontier Force, after that year the Public Safety\nDepartment was established.[127]\n\nJordan's law enforcement ranked 24th in the world, 4th in the Middle East, in\nterms of police services' reliability in the Global Competitiveness Report.\nJordan also ranked 13th in the world and 3rd in the Middle East in terms of\nprevention of organized crime, making it very safe.[14][128] The number of\nfemale police officers is on the rise in Jordan, in the 1970s it was the first\nArab country to include females into its police force.[129]\n\nThe 2010 Arab Democracy Index from the Arab Reform Initiative ranked Jordan\nfirst in the state of democratic reforms out of fifteen Arab countries.[130]\nJordan ranked first among the Arab states and 78th globally in the Human\nFreedom Index in 2015,[131] also Jordan ranked as 55th out of 175 countries\nworldwide in the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) issued by Transparency\nInternational in 2014 where 175th is most corrupt.[132]\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\nMain article: Economy of Jordan\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Jordan_Export_Treemap.\njpg/220px-Jordan_Export_Treemap.jpg)\n\nGraphical depiction of Jordan's product exports in 28 color-coded categories.\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Zahran_street_in_Amman\n.jpg/220px-Zahran_street_in_Amman.jpg)\n\nView of Zahran district in the capital city Amman\n\nJordan is classified by the World Bank as a country of \"upper-middle\nincome\",[18] however, approximately 14.4% (as of 2010[update]) of the\npopulation lives below the national poverty line.[18] The economy has grown at\nan average rate of 4.3% per annum since 2005 (as of 2011[update]).[133] The\nGDP per capita rose by 351% in the 1970s, declined 30% in the 1980s, and rose\n36% in the 1990s.[134] In 2000, Jordan joined the World Trade Organization and\nsigned the Jordan\u2013United States Free Trade Agreement, thus becoming the first\nArab country to establish a free trade agreement with the United States.\nJordan also has a free trade agreement with Turkey.[135] Jordan enjoys\nadvanced status with the EU which has allowed it to export to a number of\nEuropean countries.[136] Due to slow domestic growth, high energy and food\nsubsidies and a bloated public-sector workforce, Jordan usually runs annual\nbudget deficits. These are partially offset by international aid.[137]\n\nJordan's economy is relatively well diversified.[138] Trade and finance\ncombined account for nearly one-third of GDP; transportation and\ncommunication, public utilities, and construction account for one-fifth, and\nmining and manufacturing constitute nearly that proportion.[138] Despite plans\nto increase the private sector, the state remains the dominant force in\nJordan's economy.[138] Net official development assistance to Jordan in 2009\ntotalled USD 761 million; according to the government, approximately two-\nthirds of this was allocated as grants, of which half was direct budget\nsupport.[133] The official currency in Jordan is the Jordanian dinar, which is\npegged to the IMF's special drawing rights (SDRs), equivalent to an exchange\nrate of 1 US$ \u2261 0.709 dinar, or approximately 1 dinar \u2261 1.41044 dollars.[139]\nThe proportion of skilled workers in Jordan is among the highest in the\nregion, in sectors such as ICT and industry. This has attracted large foreign\ninvestments to Jordan. Agriculture in Jordan constituted almost 40% of GNP in\nthe early 1950s; on the eve of the Six-Day War in June 1967, it was 17%.[140]\nBy the mid-1980s, the agricultural share of Jordan's GNP was only about\n6%.[140] Jordan has hosted the World Economic Forum on the Middle East and\nNorth Africa seven times.[141]\n\nThe Great Recession and the turmoil caused by the Arab Spring have depressed\nJordan's GDP growth, impacting export-oriented sectors, construction, and\ntourism.[82] Tourist arrivals have dropped sharply since 2011, hitting an\nimportant source of revenue and employment.[142] In an attempt to quell\npopular discontent, the government promised in 2011 to keep energy and food\nprices artificially low while raising wages and pensions in the public\nsector.[142] Jordan's finances have also been severely strained by some 30\nattacks on the natural gas pipeline supplying Jordan from Egypt by ISIS\naffiliates, causing it to substitute more expensive heavy-fuel oils to\ngenerate electricity.[143] In November 2012, the government cut subsidies on\nfuel, increasing its price.[144] As a result, large scale protests broke out\nacross the country.[137] Jordan's total foreign debt in 2012 was $22 billion,\nrepresenting 72% of its GDP.[144] In 2016, the debt reached $24.9 billion\nrepresenting 90.6% of its GDP. This substantial increase is attributed to\ndecrease in tourist activity, regular annual deficits, electricital company\ndebt due to attacks on Egyptian pipeline, accumulated interests from loans,\nthe collapse of trade with Iraq and Syria and increased expenses from hosting\nSyrian refugees.[78]\n\nThe flows of remittance to Jordan had experienced rapid growth rates,\nparticularly during the end of the 1970s and 1980s, where Jordan had started\nexporting highly skilled labour to the Persian Gulf States. The money that\nmigrants send home, remittances, represents today an important source of\nexternal funding for many developing countries, including Jordan.[145]\nAccording to the World Bank data on remittances, with about 3 billion USD in\n2010, Jordan ranks at 10th place among all developing countries. Jordan has\nranked constantly among the top 20 remittances-recipient countries over the\nlast decade. In addition, the Arab Monetary Fund (AMF) statistics in 2010\nindicate that Jordan was the third biggest recipient of remittances among Arab\ncountries after Egypt and Lebanon.[146] World Bank reports show that the\nremittances of Jordanian expatriates stood at $3.8 billion in 2015, a notable\nrise in the amount of transfers compared to 2014 where remittances reached\nover $3.66 billion listing Jordan fourth in the region in terms of the volume\nof remittances in 2015.[147]\n\n### Industry[edit]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/CSCL_Rotterdam_in_Aqab\na%2C_Jordan.jpg/220px-CSCL_Rotterdam_in_Aqaba%2C_Jordan.jpg)\n\nPort of Aqaba in the southernmost city of Aqaba, Jordan's only coastal city.\n\nJordan has a very well developed industrial sector, which includes mining,\nmanufacturing, construction, and power, accounted for approximately 26 percent\nof gross domestic product in 2004 (including manufacturing, 16.2 percent;\nconstruction, 4.6 percent; and mining, 3.1 percent). More than 21 percent of\nthe country's labor force was reported to be employed in this sector in 2002.\nThe main industrial products are potash, phosphates, pharmaceuticals, cement,\nclothes, and fertilizers. The most promising segment of this sector is\nconstruction. _Petra Engineering Company_ which is considered to be one of the\nmain pillars of Jordanian industry have gained international recognition and\nhave reached the United States; Empire State Building, at NASA, in countless\nschools and buildings.[148]\n\nJordan's military industry thrived after conceiving the King Abdullah Design\nand Development Bureau (KADDB) which is a Jordanian defense company. It was\nestablished by Royal Decree on 24 August 1999 to provide an indigenous\ncapability for the supply of scientific and technical services to the\nJordanian Armed Forces (JAF). KADDB was also created for the supply of defense\nand commercial equipment optimized for Middle East requirements. It\nmanufactures all types of military products from heavy armored vehicles to\nmilitary ballistic helmets and body armors. It has started moving into\nbuilding light aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles. Many of (KADDB)'s\nproducts are presented at the bi-annually held international military\nexhibition SOFEX. KADDB also exports $72 million worth of industries into\ncountries all over the world.[149]\n\nJordan is now considered to be a leading pharmaceuticals manufacturer in the\nMENA region led by Jordanian pharmaceutical company Hikma. The Group is listed\non the London Stock Exchange. In 2015 it acquired Roxane Laboratories, the\nacquisition will transform Hikma into the sixth largest company in US\ngenerics.[150]\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\nMain article: Tourism in Jordan\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Dana_Reserve_07.jpg\n/220px-Dana_Reserve_07.jpg)\n\nDana Biosphere Reserve in south-central Jordan is a popular tourist\nattraction.\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Bethany_%285%29.JPG\n/220px-Bethany_%285%29.JPG)\n\nAl-Maghtas ruins on the Jordanian side of the Jordan River are the location\nfor the Baptism of Jesus and the ministry of John the Baptist.\n\nTourism is a cornerstone of the Jordanian economy. In 2010, there were 8\nmillion visitors to Jordan. The result was $3.4 billion in tourism revenues,\n$4.4 billion if medical tourists are included.[151] Recent regional\ninstability has severely affected Jordan's greatest source of hard currency,\nin 2015 tourism revenues dropped by some $300 million.[152] Most tourists to\nJordan come from European and Arab countries.[19] Jordan offers well preserved\nhistorical cities like Petra and Jerash. Modern entertainment in urban areas,\nmostly in Amman, also attracts tourists. Moreover, seaside recreation is\npresent in Aqaba and Dead Sea through several international resorts. Valleys\nlike Wadi Mujib attract adventurers. Jordan is part of the holy land and has\nseveral biblical attractions that attract a fair amount of pilgrimages, sites\ninclude; Al-Maghtas (baptism site), Mount Nebo, Umm ar-Rasas and Madaba.\n\nJordan has nightclubs, discoth\u00e8ques, bars and beach clubs available. Alcohol\nis widely available in restaurants, liquor stores and even supermarkets.\nJordan played host to the Petra Prana Festival in 2007 which celebrated\nPetra's win as one of the New Seven Wonders of the World with world-renowned\nDJs like Tiesto and Sarah Main.[153]\n\nJordan has been a medical tourism destination in the Middle East since the\n1970s. A study conducted by Jordan's Private Hospitals Association (PHA) found\nthat 250,000 patients from 102 countries received treatment in the kingdom in\n2010, compared to 190,000 in 2007, bringing over $1 billion in revenue. It is\nthe region's top medical tourism destination as rated by the World Bank and\nfifth in the world overall.[154][155][156] The majority of patients come from\nYemen, Libya and Syria due to the political instability the respective\ncountries face. Jordanian doctors and medical staff have gained experience in\ndealing with war patients, throughout years of receiving such cases from\nvarious conflict zones in the region.[157] Jordan's main focus of attention in\nits marketing effort are the ex-Soviet states, Europe, and America.[158] Most\ncommon medical procedures on Arab and foreign patients included organ\ntransplants, open heart surgeries, infertility treatment, laser vision\ncorrections, bone operations and cancer treatment.[159]\n\nJordan also is a hub for natural treatment methods including its natural hot\nsprings and the Dead Sea which is described as a 'natural spa'. It contains 10\ntimes more salt than the average ocean, this has made the lake impossible to\nsink in due to the high salt concentration which makes this lake unique, on a\nglobal level. The high salt concentration of the Dead Sea has been proven as\ntherapeutic for many skin diseases which made the area a major tourist\ndestination.[160] Nature reserves in Jordan include the Dana Biosphere\nReserve, Azraq Wetland Reserve, Shaumari Wildlife Reserve and Mujib Nature\nReserve.[20]\n\n### Natural resources[edit]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Aqaba_Railway_Corporat\nion_BW_1.JPG/220px-Aqaba_Railway_Corporation_BW_1.JPG)\n\nA phosphate train at Ram station.\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Ajlun_Green_02.jpg\n/220px-Ajlun_Green_02.jpg)\n\nA rare forest in Ajloun, northern Jordan.\n\nPhosphate mines in the south have made Jordan one of the largest producers and\nexporters of this mineral in the world.[161][162]\n\nNatural gas was discovered in Jordan in 1987. The estimated size of the\nreserve discovered was about 230 billion cubic feet, a modest quantity\ncompared with its other Arabian neighbours. The Risha field, in the Eastern\nDesert beside the Iraqi border, produces nearly 35 million cubic feet of gas a\nday, which is sent to a nearby power plant to produce nearly 10% of Jordan's\nelectricity needs.[163] Jordan aims to benefit from its large uranium reserves\nwith three nuclear plants scheduled for completion in 2025.[164] Water is very\nscarce in Jordan. Jordan is the world's second most poorest country in terms\nof water resources per capita.[16]\n\nDespite the fact that reserves of crude oil are non-commercial, Jordan\npossesses one of the world's richest stockpiles of oil shale where there are\nhuge quantities (5th largest oil-shale reserves in the world) that could be\ncommercially exploited in the central and northern regions west of the\ncountry.[165] Official figures estimate the kingdom's oil shale reserves at\nmore than 70 billion tonnes. A $2.2 billion oil shale-dependent power plant\nwill be completed in 2019 with a total capacity of 470 megawatts. The project\nis part of the kingdom's 2025 vision that aims towards diversifying its energy\nresources.[166] This shale oil sits under 60% of Jordan's surface.[167] The\nmoisture content and ash within is relatively low. And the total thermal value\nis 7.5 megajoules/kg, and the content of ointments reach 9% of the weight of\nthe organic content.[168] A switch to power plants operated by oil shale has\nthe potential to reduce Jordan's energy bill by at least 40\u201350 per cent,\naccording to the National Electric Power Company.[169] However, Jordan's oil\nshale also has a high sulphur content. The extraction of oil shale had been\ndelayed by a couple of years due to the advanced level of technology that is\nrequired to extract it and its relatively higher cost.[165]\n\nJordan receives 330 days of sun per year, and wind speeds reach over 7\u00a0m/s\nover the mountainous areas,[170] for this reason, the Ministry of Energy and\nMineral Resources have set a target to obtain 10% of energy from renewable\nresources by 2020.[171] As of November 2014 Jordan had 10MW of installed\ncapacity from renewable energy, and had over 15 renewable energy power plants\nin progress to be completed by the end of 2015, raising the installed capacity\nto 500MW, representing 14% of the overall installed capacity.[172]\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\nMain article: Transport in Jordan\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Queen_Alia_Internation\nal_Airport_Terminal.jpg/220px-Queen_Alia_International_Airport_Terminal.jpg)\n\nQueen Alia International Airport near Amman.\n\nJordan ranked as having the 35th best infrastructure in the world, one of the\nhighest rankings in the developing world, according to the World Economic\nForum's Index of Economic Competitiveness. As it is a transit country for\ngoods and services to the Palestinian territories and Iraq. Palestinians use\nJordan as a transit country due to the Israeli restrictions and the Iraqis use\nJordan due to the instability in Iraq.[173]\n\nAccording to data from the Jordanian Ministry of Public Works and Housing, as\nof 2011[update] the Jordanian road network consisted of 2,878\u00a0km (1,788\u00a0mi) of\nmain roads; 2,592\u00a0km (1,611\u00a0mi) of rural roads and 1,733\u00a0km (1,077\u00a0mi) of side\nroads. The Hejaz Railway built during the Ottoman Empire which extended from\nDamascus to Mecca will act as a base for future railway expansion plans.\nCurrently, the railway has barely any civilian activity. It is primarily used\nfor transporting goods.[174]\n\nJordan has three commercial airports, all receiving and dispatching\ninternational flights. Two are in Amman and the third is in Aqaba; King\nHussein International Airport. Amman Civil Airport serves several regional\nroutes. Queen Alia International Airport is the major international airport in\nJordan and the hub for Royal Jordanian, the flag carrier. Its expansion was\nrecently done with new terminals costing $700M, to handle over 16 million\npassengers annually.[175] It is now considered a state-of-the-art airport and\nwas rewarded 'the best airport by region: Middle East' for the year 2014 and\n2015, and 'the best improvement by region:Middle East' for 2014 by Airport\nService Quality (ASQ) survey, the world's leading airport passenger\nsatisfaction benchmark program.[176]\n\nThe Port of Aqaba is the only port in Jordan. In 2006, the port was ranked as\nbeing the \"Best Container Terminal\" in the Middle East by _Lloyd's List_. The\nport was chosen due to it being a transit cargo for other neighboring\ncountries, its location between four countries and three continents, being an\nexclusive gateway for the local market and for the improvements it has\nrecently witnessed.[177]\n\n### Science and technology[edit]\n\nMain article: Science and technology in Jordan\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Station_solaire_de_rec\nharge.JPG/220px-Station_solaire_de_recharge.JPG)\n\nA solar charging station in King Hussein Business Park.\n\nScience and Technology is the country's fastest developing economic sector.\nThis growth occurs across multiple industries including Information and\nCommunications Technology, and Nuclear Technology. Jordan contributes 75\npercent of the Arabic content on the Internet.[178] In fact, the Information\nand Communications Technology sector accounts for more than 84,000 jobs, and\ncontributes 14 percent to the GDP. There are 400 companies Jordan operating\nacross the spectrum of telecom, IT, on-line and mobile content, business\noutsourcing, and video game development. It has been estimated that these\nsubsections of the Information and Communications Technology industry will\ncreate over 18,000 jobs over the next five years (2015\u20132020).[179][180]\n\nNuclear Science and Technology is also expanding, nuclear facilities are under\ngoing construction; the first one under construction by DAEWOO called Jordan\nResearch and Training Reactor which is a 5MW training reactor located in\nJordan University of Science and Technology it is currently expected to start\noperations in summer of 2016 and will be used by the university to train their\nstudents in the already existing Nuclear Engineering program. The other two\nnuclear reactors are under planning and are expected to start delivering\nelectricity in 2025.[164]\n\nJordan was also selected as the location for the Synchrotron-Light for\nExperimental Science Applications in the Middle East (SESAME). This particle\naccelerator will allow collaboration between scientists across the Middle East\ndespite the political conflicts.[181]\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\nMain article: Demographics of Jordan\n\nIn 1920, Transjordan had a population of 200,000, which grew to 225,000 in\n1922 and 400,000 in 1948.[182] Jordan conducted 6 censuses after its\nindependence, first of which was in 1952 where the population numbered\n586,200. The population grew to 900,800 in 1961, 2,133,000 in 1979, 4,139,500\nin 1994, 5,100,000 in 2004 and 9,531,712 in 2015.[183] The 9.5 million\npopulation in 2015 consisted of 2.9 million non-citizens, many of these\nrefugees from war and some of which were illegal immigrants.[11][184] As the\npopulation increased it also became more settled and more urban. Almost half\nof the population in 1922 (around 103,000) was nomadic.[182] In 1946 Amman had\na population of 65,754 which grew to over 4 million in 2015.[11] There were\n946,000 households in Jordan in 2004, with an average of 5.3 persons per\nhousehold (compared to 6 persons per household for the census of 1994).[185]\nThe vast majority of Jordanians are Arabs, accounting for 98% of the\npopulation. The rest is attributed to other ethnic minorities which include 1%\nCircassian and 1% Armenians.[82]\n\n### Immigrants and refugees[edit]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/An_Aerial_View_of_the_\nZa%27atri_Refugee_Camp.jpg/220px-\nAn_Aerial_View_of_the_Za%27atri_Refugee_Camp.jpg)\n\nAerial view of a portion of the Zaatari refugee camp which only contains a\npopulation of 80,000 Syrian refugees.\n\nAccording to UNRWA, Jordan was home to 1,951,603 Palestinians in 2008, most of\nthem Jordanian citizens. The first wave of Palestinian refugees started during\nthe 1948 Arab Israeli war and peaked in the 1967 Six Day War and the 1990 Gulf\nWar. In the past, Jordan had given some Palestinian refugees citizenship.\nHowever recently, Jordanian citizenship is only given in very rare cases.[186]\n338,000 of them were living in UNRWA refugee camps.[187] Jordan revoked the\ncitizenship of thousands of Palestinians to thwart any attempt to permanently\nresettle West Bank residents in Jordan. West Bank Palestinians with family in\nJordan or Jordanian citizenship were issued yellow cards guaranteeing them all\nthe rights of Jordanian citizenship if requested. Palestinians living in\nJordan with family in the West Bank were also issued yellow cards. All other\nPalestinians wishing such Jordanian papers were issued green cards to\nfacilitate travel into Jordan.[188]\n\nFollowing the Iraq War in 2003, some 700,000\u20131,000,000 Iraqis came to Jordan,\nhowever, most have returned.[189] Since the Iraq War, many Christians\n(Assyrians/Chaldeans) from Iraq have settled permanently or temporarily in\nJordan.[190] There were also 15,000 Lebanese who emigrated to Jordan following\nthe 2006 War with Israel.[191] Since 2010, over 1.4 million Syrian refugees\nhave fled to Jordan to escape the violence in Syria.[11] Jordan takes care of\n63% of the total costs of the Syrian refugee crisis in the country.[192] The\nkingdom has continued to demonstrate hospitality, despite the substantial\nstrain the Syrian refugees are holding on Jordanian communities and their\ninfrastructure. Some of which include competition on job opportunities, water\nresources and other state provided services.[12]\n\nAssyrian Christians account for up to 150,000 persons, or 0.8% of the\npopulation. Most are Eastern Aramaic speaking refugees from Iraq.[193][194]\nKurds, number some 30,000 people, and like the Assyrians, many are refugees\nfrom Iraq, Iran and Turkey.[195] Armenians number approximately 6,500 persons,\nmainly residing in Amman.[196] A small number of ethnic Mandeans also reside\nin Jordan, again mainly refugees from Iraq. There are around 1.2 million\nillegal and some 500,000 legal migrant workers in the Kingdom.[197]\nFurthermore, there are thousands of foreign women working in nightclubs,\nhotels and bars across the kingdom, mostly from Greater Middle East and\nEastern Europe.[198][199][200] Jordan is home to a relatively large American\nand European expatriate population concentrated mainly in the capital as the\ncity is home to many international organizations and diplomatic missions that\nbase their regional operations in Amman.[82][201] As of 2015[update], several\nthousand Libyans, Yemenis and Sudanese have also sought asylum in Jordan to\nescape instability and violence in their respective countries.[12]\n\nThe 2015 Jordanian census revealed that there are 1,265,000 Syrians, 636,270\nEgyptians, 634,182 Palestinians, 130,911 Iraqis, 31,163 Yemenis, 22,700\nLibyans and 197,385 from other nationalities residing in the country.[11]\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\nMain article: Religion in Jordan\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Aqaba_Mosque.jpg\n/220px-Aqaba_Mosque.jpg)\n\nMarsa Zayed mosque in Aqaba\n\nSunni Islam is the dominant religion in Jordan. Muslims make up about 92% of\nthe country's population; in turn, 93% of those self-identify as Sunnis\u2014the\nhighest percentage in the world, according to the Pew Research Center.[23]\nThere are a small number of Ahmadi Muslims.[202] However, the kingdom\nsometimes falls short of protecting all minority groups. Muslims who convert\nto another religion as well as missionaries face societal and legal\ndiscrimination.[203]\n\nJordan has a Christian minority making up about 6% of the population, down\nfrom 30% in 1950. This is due to high immigration rates of Muslims into\nJordan, high emigration rates of Christians to the west and higher birth rates\nfor Muslims.[13][204] Christians traditionally occupy two Cabinet posts, and\nare officially reserved 9 seats out of the 130 in Parliament.[205] The highest\npolitical position reached by a Christian is deputy prime minister, held by\nMarwan al-Muasher in 2005.[206] Christians are also very influential in media,\nthey own Jordan's most popular TV channel called Ro'ya TV. Christian Arabs,\nhelped by their Western-oriented education and knowledge of foreign languages,\ndominate business. A study in 1987 by a Western embassy concluded that almost\nhalf of Jordan's leading business families are Christian.[207] The world's\nfirst purpose-built church is located in the city of Aqaba and 16 historic\nchurches exist at the UNESCO world heritage site in Amman called Umm ar-\nRasas.[46]\n\nOther, smaller religious minorities include Druze and Bah\u00e1'\u00eds. Most Jordanian\nDruze live in the eastern oasis town of Azraq, some villages on the Syrian\nborder, and the city of Zarqa, while most Jordanian Bah\u00e1'\u00eds live in the\nvillage of Adassiyeh bordering the Jordan Valley.[208] Non-Sunni Muslims in\nJordan are few but include some Shiites, of which some belong to Iraqi and\nLebanese refugees.[209]\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\nThe official language is Modern Standard Arabic, a literary language taught in\nthe schools.[210] Most Jordanians speak natively one of the dialects of\nJordanian Arabic, a nonstandard version of Arabic. Jordanian Sign Language is\nthe language of the deaf community. English, though without an official\nstatus, is widely spoken throughout the country and is the _de facto_ language\nof commerce and banking, as well as a co-official status in the education\nsector; almost all university-level classes are held in English. Chechen,\nCircassian, Armenian, Tagalog, and Russian are quite popular among their\ncommunities.[211]\n\nMost, if not all, public schools in the country teach English and Standard\nArabic. French is elective in many schools, mainly in the private sector.\nL'Ecole fran\u00e7aise d'Amman and Lyc\u00e9e fran\u00e7ais d'Amman are the most famous\nFrench language schools in the capital. French remains an elite language in\nJordan, though not enjoying the popularity it once did. German is an\nincreasingly popular language among the elite and the educated; it's been most\nlikely introduced at a larger scale after the d\u00e9but of the German-Jordanian\nUniversity in 2005.[212] A historic society of German Protestants of Amman\ncontinue to use the German language in their events and daily lives.[213]\n\nThe media in Jordan revolves mainly around English, with many British and\nAmerican programmes and films shown on local television and cinemas. Egyptian\nArabic is very popular, with many Egyptian movies playing in cinemas across\nthe country. The government-owned _Jordan TV_ shows programmes and newscasts\nin Arabic (Standard and Jordanian), English and French; _Radio Jordan_ offers\nradio services in Standard Arabic, the Jordanian dialects (informally),\nEnglish and French, as well. When an English-language film is shown in a\ncinema, translations into both French and Standard Arabic are available.[211]\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\nMain article: Culture of Jordan\n\nReligion and tradition play an important part in modern Jordanian society;\nhowever, the country is considered liberal, relative to the other Arab\ncountries as it grapples with globalization.[214]\n\n### Arts[edit]\n\nMain articles: Jordanian art, Cinema of Jordan and Music of Jordan\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Pipers_jordaniens_%28J\nerash%29_%286949582694%29.jpg/220px-\nPipers_jordaniens_%28Jerash%29_%286949582694%29.jpg)\n\nJordanian military marching band playing bagpipes at Jerash\n\nArt in Jordan is represented through many Institutions with the aim to\nincrease the cultural awareness in plastic and visual arts and to represent\nthe artistic movement in Jordan and its wide spectrum of creativity in various\nfields such as paintings, sculpture, video art, photography, graphic arts,\nceramics and installations. The Jordan National Gallery of Fine Arts is a\nmajor contemporary art museum located in Amman, Jordan.[215] The art scene has\nbeen developing in the past few years[216] and Jordan has been a haven for\nartists from surrounding countries.[217] In January 2016, for the first time\never, a Jordanian film called Theeb was nominated for the 88th Academy Awards\nfor Best Foreign Language Film.[218]\n\nMusic in Jordan is now developing by a lot of new musicians and artist, who\nare now popular in the Middle East such as singer and composer Toni Qattan and\nsinger Hani Metwasi who changed the old notion about the music of Jordan which\nwas unpopular for many years. Along with an increasing growth of Alternative\nArabic music bands, who are dominating the scene in the Arab World like;\nJadaL, El Morabba3, Autostrad, Ayloul and many more. Jordanian pianist and\ncomposer Zade Dirani has wide international popularity. Rebab is a traditional\nBedouin musical instrument.[219]\n\nThe largest museum in Jordan is the Jordan Archaeological Museum. It contains\nmuch of the valuable archaeological findings in the country,[220] including\nsome of the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Neolithic limestone statues of 'Ain Ghazal\nand a copy of Mesha Stele. Most museums in Jordan are located in Amman\nincluding the The Children's Museum Jordan, The Martyr's Memorial and Museum\nand the Royal Automobile Museum. Museums outside Amman include the Aqaba\nArchaeological Museum.[215]\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\nMain article: Sport in Jordan\n\nFootball is the most spread sport in Jordan.[87] The national football team\nhas improved in recent years, though it has yet to qualify for the World Cup.\nIt reached 37th in September 2004 according to the FIFA Rankings though has\nsince fallen. Little Leagues and Youth Clubs related to football are also\nwidespread in Jordan, some of which are supervised and run by the Jordan\nFootball Association.[215] In 2013, Jordan lost a chance to play at the 2014\nWorld Cup when they lost to Uruguay the home match 5-0 and held the former\nWorld Cup champs 0-0 in the away match. This was the furthest that Jordan had\nreached in the World Cup qualifying rounds since 1986.[221] Jordan's women\nfootball team is also gaining reputation,[222] which in 2016 reached a ranking\nof 58th.[223] The country is hosting the 2016 FIFA U-17 Women's World\nCup.[224]\n\nHowever, other uncommon sports are expanding. Rugby is on the rise in Jordan\nand hundreds of people are playing and watching it. Jordan has several\nnational teams for rugby, there are two clubs in Amman that play in Petra\nUniversity they are Amman Citadel Rugby Club[225] and the _Nomads_. And one\nclub in Aqaba called _Aqaba Sharks_. Although cycling is not well known in\nJordan, the sport is developing rapidly as a lifestyle and a new way to travel\nand explore the country especially among the youth. In 2014, a non-profit\norganization Make Life Skate Life completed construction of the 7Hills\nSkatepark, a 650 square meters concrete skatepark located at Samir Rifai park\nin Downtown Amman.[226]\n\nBasketball is also played. Jordan's national basketball team is now being\nsponsored by Zain and participating in various Arab and Middle East basketball\ncompetitions. Local teams include: Al-Orthodoxi Club, Al-Riyadi, Zain, Al-\nHussein and Al-Jazeera.[227]\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\nMain article: Jordanian cuisine\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Sakib_mansaf.jpg\n/220px-Sakib_mansaf.jpg)\n\nTraditional dish of Jordan, Mansaf\n\nAs one of the largest producers of olives in the world,[228] olive oil is the\nmain cooking oil in Jordan. Herbs, garlic, spices, onion, tomato sauce and\nlemon are typical flavours found in Jordan. A common appetizer is hummus,\nwhich is a puree of chick peas blended with tahini, lemon, and garlic. Ful\nMedames is another well-known appetiser. A workers meal, today it has made its\nway to the tables of the upper class. A typical Jordanian meze must of course\nhave koubba maqliya, labaneh, baba ghanoush, tabbouleh, olives and\npickles.[229] Meze is generally accompanied by the Levantine alcoholic drink\nArak, which is made from grapes and aniseed and is similar to Ouzo, Rak\u0131 and\nPastis. The same dishes, served without alcoholic drinks, can also be termed\n\"muqabbilat\" (starters) in Arabic.[87]\n\nThe most distinctive Jordanian dish is mansaf, the national dish of\nJordan,[230] a symbol in Jordanian culture for generosity. Although simple\nfresh fruit is often served towards the end of a Jordanian meal, there is also\ndessert, such as baklava, hareeseh, knafeh, halva and qatayef a dish made\nspecially for Ramadan. In Jordanian cuisine, drinking coffee and tea flavored\nwith na'na or meramiyyeh is almost a ritual.[231]\n\n## Health[edit]\n\nMain article: Health in Jordan\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/JUSTmed.jpg/220px-\nJUSTmed.jpg)\n\nMedical halls of Jordan University of Science and Technology as seen with the\nuniversity hospital in the background in the northernmost city of Ar-Ramtha.\n\nJordan prides itself on its health service, one of the best in the\nregion.[232] Qualified medics and the investment climate has created a good\nreputation for the country's medical sector. Also, Jordan's stability has\nallowed its medical sector to develop unlike in other neighboring\ncountries.[233] Government figures have put total health spending in 2002 at\nsome 7.5% of Gross domestic product (GDP), while international health\norganizations place the figure even higher, at approximately 9.3% of GDP. The\nCIA World Factbook estimates life expectancy in Jordan for males to be 73\nyears and 75.78 years for females, for total population the life expectancy is\n74.35 years.[82] The leading cause of death in the country is attributed to\ncardiovascular diseases followed by cancer.[234]\n\nThe country's health care system is divided between public and private\ninstitutions. In the public sector, the Ministry of Health operates 1,245\nprimary health-care centers and 27 hospitals, accounting for 37% of all\nhospital beds in the country; the military's Royal Medical Services runs 11\nhospitals, providing 24% of all beds; and the Jordan University Hospital\naccounts for 3% of total beds in the country. The private sector provides 36%\nof all hospital beds, distributed among 56 hospitals. On 1 June 2007, Jordan\nHospital (as the biggest private hospital) was the first general specialty\nhospital to gain the international accreditation JCAHO.[235] The King Hussein\nCancer Center is a leading cancer treatment center.[236]\n\n70% of the population has medical insurance.[237] Childhood immunization rates\nhave increased steadily over the past 15 years; by 2002 immunizations and\nvaccines reached more than 95% of children under five.[235] Water and\nsanitation, available to only 10% of the population in 1950, now reach 99% of\nJordanians, according to government statistics.\n\n## Education[edit]\n\nMain article: Education in Jordan\n\nThe Jordanian educational system consists of a two-year cycle of pre-school\neducation, ten years of compulsory basic education, and two years of secondary\nacademic or vocational education, after which the students sit for the\n_Tawjihi_.[238] UNESCO ranked Jordan's education system 18th out of 94 nations\nfor providing gender equality in education.[239] 20.5% of Jordan's total\ngovernment expenditures goes to education.[240] Education is not free in\nJordan.[241] 79% of children are go through primary education while Secondary\nschool enrolment has increased from 63% to 97% of high school aged students in\nJordan and between 79% and 85% of high school students in Jordan move on to\nhigher education.[242] The adult literacy rate in 2013 was 97%.[243]\n\nThere are 2,000 researchers per million people, compared to 5,000 researchers\nper million for the highest-performing countries.[244] According to the Global\nInnovation Index 2011, Jordan is the third-most innovative economy in the\nMiddle East, behind Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.[245]\n\nJordan has 10 public universities, 16 private universities and 54 community\ncolleges, of which 14 are public, 24 private and others affiliated with the\nJordanian Armed Forces, the Civil Defence Department, the Ministry of Health\nand UNRWA.[246] There are over 200,000 Jordanian students enrolled in\nuniversities each year. An additional 20,000 Jordanians pursue higher\neducation abroad primarily in the United States and Great Britain.[247] Jordan\nis already home to several international universities such as German-Jordanian\nUniversity, Columbia University, DePaul University and the American University\nof Madaba. According to the Webometrics Ranking of World Universities, the\ntop-ranking universities in the country are the University of Jordan (1,010th\nworldwide), Jordan University of Science &amp; Technology (1,907th) and\nYarmouk University (1,969th).[248] Regionally, two Jordanian universities rank\namong the top 10 Arab Universities in 2014, according to the QS Intelligence\nUnit report, these are the University of Jordan (8th) and Jordan University of\nScience and Technology (10th).[249]\n\nPrior to the millennium, there are very few documented efforts toward\nincorporating environmental education into the school system. In the late\n2000s, Jordan implemented several environmental education programs in schools\nto assess the correlation between education and environmental practices of\nfamilies in Jordan.[250]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n![Portal\nicon](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Flag_of_Jordan.svg\n/32px-Flag_of_Jordan.svg.png) | Jordan portal  \n---|---  \n![Portal icon](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/MiddleEast_\nblacky.svg/31px-MiddleEast_blacky.svg.png) | Middle East portal  \n  \n  * Outline of Jordan\n  * Index of Jordan-related articles\n  * List of World Heritage Sites in Jordan\n  * Google Street View in Jordan\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. **^** Temperman, Jeroen (2010). _State-Religion Relationships and Human Rights Law: Towards a Right to Religiously Neutral Governance_.

(Spanish: _Guerra de las Malvinas_), also known as the\n**Falklands Conflict**, **Falklands Crisis**, and the _Guerra del Atl\u00e1ntico\nSur_ (Spanish for \"**South Atlantic War**\"), was a ten-week war between\nArgentina and the United Kingdom over two British overseas territories in the\nSouth Atlantic: the Falkland Islands and South Georgia and the South Sandwich\nIslands. It began on Friday, 2 April 1982, when Argentina invaded and occupied\nthe Falkland Islands (and, the following day, South Georgia and the South\nSandwich Islands) in an attempt to establish the sovereignty it had claimed\nover them. On 5 April, the British government dispatched a naval task force to\nengage the Argentine Navy and Air Force before making an amphibious assault on\nthe islands. The conflict lasted 74 days and ended with the Argentine\nsurrender on 14 June 1982, returning the islands to British control. In total,\n649 Argentine military personnel, 255 British military personnel, and three\nFalkland Islanders died during the hostilities.\n\nThe conflict was a major episode in the protracted confrontation over the\nterritories' sovereignty. Argentina asserted (and maintains) that the islands\nare Argentine territory,[6] and the Argentine government thus characterised\nits military action as the reclamation of its own territory. The British\ngovernment regarded the action as an invasion of a territory that had been a\nCrown colony since 1841. Falkland Islanders, who have inhabited the islands\nsince the early 19th century, are predominantly descendants of British\nsettlers, and favour British sovereignty. Neither state, however, officially\ndeclared war (both sides did declare the Islands areas a war zone and\nofficially recognised that a state of war existed between them) and\nhostilities were almost exclusively limited to the territories under dispute\nand the area of the South Atlantic where they lie.\n\nThe conflict has had a strong impact in both countries and has been the\nsubject of various books, articles, films, and songs. Patriotic sentiment ran\nhigh in Argentina, but the outcome prompted large protests against the ruling\nmilitary government, hastening its downfall. In the United Kingdom, the\nConservative Party government, bolstered by the successful outcome, was re-\nelected the following year. The cultural and political weight of the conflict\nhas had less effect in Britain than in Argentina, where it remains a continued\ntopic for discussion.[7]\n\nRelations between the United Kingdom and Argentina were restored in 1989\nfollowing a meeting in Madrid, Spain, at which the two countries' governments\nissued a joint statement.[8] No change in either country's position regarding\nthe sovereignty of the Falkland Islands was made explicit. In 1994,\nArgentina's claim to the territories was added to its constitution.[9]\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Lead-up to the conflict\n  * 2 Argentine invasion\n    * 2.1 Initial British response\n    * 2.2 Position of third party countries\n  * 3 British Task Force\n    * 3.1 Recapture of South Georgia and the attack on _Santa Fe_\n    * 3.2 Black Buck raids\n    * 3.3 Escalation of the air war\n    * 3.4 Sinking of ARA _General Belgrano_\n    * 3.5 Sinking of HMS _Sheffield_\n    * 3.6 British special forces operations\n  * 4 Land battles\n    * 4.1 Landing at San Carlos\u2014Bomb Alley\n    * 4.2 Battle of Goose Green\n    * 4.3 Special forces on Mount Kent\n    * 4.4 Bluff Cove and Fitzroy\n    * 4.5 Fall of Stanley\n  * 5 Recapture of South Sandwich Islands\n  * 6 Casualties\n    * 6.1 Red Cross Box\n    * 6.2 British casualty evacuation\n  * 7 Aftermath\n    * 7.1 Military analysis\n    * 7.2 Memorials\n    * 7.3 Minefields\n  * 8 Press and publicity\n    * 8.1 Argentina\n    * 8.2 United Kingdom\n  * 9 Cultural impact\n  * 10 See also\n  * 11 Notes\n  * 12 References\n  * 13 Bibliography\n    * 13.1 Historiography\n  * 14 External links\n\n## Lead-up to the conflict[edit]\n\nMain article: Events leading to the Falklands War\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Galtieri.jpg/180px-\nGaltieri.jpg)\n\nLieutenant General Leopoldo Galtieri, leader of the Argentine Junta\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Jorge_Anaya.JPG/194px-\nJorge_Anaya.JPG)\n\nAdmiral Jorge Anaya was the driving force in the Junta's decision to\ninvade.[10][11][12]\n\nIn the period leading up to the war\u00a0\u2013 and, in particular, following the\ntransfer of power between the military dictators General Jorge Rafael Videla\nand General Roberto Eduardo Viola late in March 1981\u00a0\u2013 Argentina had been in\nthe midst of a devastating economic stagnation and large-scale civil unrest\nagainst the military _junta_ that had been governing the country since\n1976.[13] In December 1981 there was a further change in the Argentine\nmilitary regime bringing to office a new _junta_ headed by General Leopoldo\nGaltieri (acting president), Brigadier Basilio Lami Dozo and Admiral Jorge\nAnaya. Anaya was the main architect and supporter of a military solution for\nthe long-standing claim over the islands,[14] calculating that the United\nKingdom would never respond militarily.[15]\n\nBy opting for military action, the Galtieri government hoped to mobilise the\nlong-standing patriotic feelings of Argentines towards the islands, and thus\ndivert public attention from the country's chronic economic problems and the\nregime's ongoing human rights violations.[16] Such action would also bolster\nits dwindling legitimacy. The newspaper _La Prensa_ speculated in a step-by-\nstep plan beginning with cutting off supplies to the Islands, ending in direct\nactions late in 1982, if the UN talks were fruitless.[17]\n\nThe ongoing tension between the two countries over the islands increased on 19\nMarch when a group of Argentine scrap metal merchants (actually infiltrated by\nArgentine marines) raised the Argentine flag at South Georgia, an act that\nwould later be seen as the first offensive action in the war. The Royal Navy\nice patrol vessel HMS\u00a0_Endurance_ was dispatched from Stanley to South Georgia\nin response, subsequently leading to the invasion of South Georgia by\nArgentine forces on 3 April. The Argentine military junta, suspecting that the\nUK would reinforce its South Atlantic Forces,[18] ordered the invasion of the\nFalkland Islands to be brought forward to 2 April.\n\nBritain was initially taken by surprise by the Argentine attack on the South\nAtlantic islands, despite repeated warnings by Royal Navy captain Nicholas\nBarker and others. Barker believed that Defence Secretary John Nott's 1981\nreview (in which Nott described plans to withdraw the _Endurance_, Britain's\nonly naval presence in the South Atlantic) sent a signal to the Argentines\nthat Britain was unwilling, and would soon be unable, to defend its\nterritories and subjects in the Falklands.[19][20]\n\n## Argentine invasion[edit]\n\nMain articles: 1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands, Invasion of South\nGeorgia, Argentine air forces in the Falklands War, Argentine naval forces in\nthe Falklands War and Argentine ground forces in the Falklands War\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/ARASant%C3%ADsimaTrini\ndadD-2.jpg/190px-ARASant%C3%ADsimaTrinidadD-2.jpg)\n\nThe Argentine destroyer ARA Sant\u00edsima Trinidad landed Special Forces south of\nStanley\n\nOn 2 April 1982, Argentine forces mounted amphibious landings off the Falkland\nIslands, following the civilian occupation of South Georgia on 19 March,\nbefore the Falklands War began. The invasion was met with a nominal defence\norganised by the Falkland Islands' Governor Sir Rex Hunt, giving command to\nMajor Mike Norman of the Royal Marines. The events of the invasion included\nthe landing of Lieutenant Commander Guillermo Sanchez-Sabarots' Amphibious\nCommandos Group, the attack on Moody Brook barracks, the engagement between\nthe troops of Hugo Santillan and Bill Trollope at Stanley, and the final\nengagement and surrender at Government House.\n\n### Initial British response[edit]\n\nFurther information: British naval forces in the Falklands War, British ground\nforces in the Falklands War and British air services in the Falklands War\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7a/The_empire_strikes_back_new\nsweek.jpg/170px-The_empire_strikes_back_newsweek.jpg)\n\nThe cover of _Newsweek_ magazine, 19 April 1982, depicts HMS\u00a0_Hermes_,\nflagship of the British Task Force. The title references the 1980 _Star Wars_\nsequel.\n\nWord of the invasion first reached Britain from Argentine sources.[21] A\nMinistry of Defence operative in London had a short telex conversation with\nGovernor Hunt's telex operator, who confirmed that Argentines were on the\nisland and in control.[21][22] Later that day, BBC journalist Laurie Margolis\nspoke with an islander at Goose Green via amateur radio, who confirmed the\npresence of a large Argentine fleet and that Argentine forces had taken\ncontrol of the island.[21][23] _Operation Corporate_ was the codename given to\nthe British military operations in the Falklands War. The commander of task\nforce operations was Admiral Sir John Fieldhouse. Operations lasted from 1\nApril 1982 to 20 June 1982.[24] The British undertook a series of military\noperations as a means of recapturing the Falklands from Argentine occupation.\nThe British government had taken action prior to the 2 April invasion. In\nresponse to events on South Georgia, the submarines HMS\u00a0_Splendid_ and HMS\n_Spartan_ were ordered to sail south on 29 March, whilst the stores ship Royal\nFleet Auxiliary (RFA) _Fort Austin_ was dispatched from the Western\nMediterranean to support HMS _Endurance_.[25] Lord Carrington had wished to\nsend a third submarine, but the decision was deferred due to concerns about\nthe impact on operational commitments.[25] Coincidentally, on 26 March, the\nsubmarine HMS\u00a0_Superb_ left Gibraltar and it was assumed in the press it was\nheading south. There has since been speculation that the effect of those\nreports was to panic the Argentine junta into invading the Falklands before\nnuclear submarines could be deployed.[25]\n\nThe following day, during a crisis meeting headed by the Prime Minister\nMargaret Thatcher, the Chief of the Naval Staff, Admiral Sir Henry Leach,\nadvised them that \"Britain could and should send a task force if the islands\nare invaded\". On 1 April, Leach sent orders to a Royal Navy force carrying out\nexercises in the Mediterranean to prepare to sail south. Following the\ninvasion on 2 April, after an emergency meeting of the cabinet, approval was\ngiven to form a task force to retake the islands. This was backed in an\nemergency session of the House of Commons the next day.[26]\n\nOn 6 April, the British Government set up a War Cabinet to provide day-to-day\npolitical oversight of the campaign.[3] This was the critical instrument of\ncrisis management for the British with its remit being to \"keep under review\npolitical and military developments relating to the South Atlantic, and to\nreport as necessary to the Defence and Overseas Policy Committee\". Until it\nwas dissolved on 12 August, the War Cabinet met at least daily. Although\nMargaret Thatcher is described as dominating the War Cabinet, Lawrence\nFreedman notes in the _Official History of the Falklands Campaign_ that she\ndid not ignore opposition or fail to consult others. However, once a decision\nwas reached she _\"did not look back\"_.[3]\n\n### Position of third party countries[edit]\n\nOn the evening of 3 April, the United Kingdom's United Nations ambassador Sir\nAnthony Parsons put a draft resolution to the United Nations Security Council.\nThe resolution, which condemned the hostilities and demanded the immediate\nArgentine withdrawal from the Islands, was adopted by the council the\nfollowing day as United Nations Security Council Resolution 502, which passed\nwith ten votes in support, one against (Panama) and four abstentions (China,\nthe Soviet Union, Poland and Spain).[26][27][28] The UK received further\npolitical support from the Commonwealth of Nations and the European Economic\nCommunity. The EEC also provided economic support by imposing economic\nsanctions on Argentina. Argentina itself was politically backed by a majority\nof countries in Latin America and some members of the Non-Aligned\nMovement.[_citation needed_] On 20 May 1982, the Prime Minister of New\nZealand, Rob Muldoon, announced that he would make HMNZS _Canterbury_, a\nLeander-class frigate, available for use where the British thought fit to\nrelease a Royal Navy vessel for the Falklands.[29]\n\nThe war was an unexpected event in a world strained by the Cold War and the\nNorth\u2013South divide. The response of some countries was the effort to mediate\nthe crisis and later as the war began, the support (or criticism) based in\nterms of anti-colonialism, political solidarity, historical relationships or\nrealpolitik.\n\nThe United States was concerned by the prospect of Argentina turning to the\nSoviet Union for support,[30] and initially tried to mediate an end to the\nconflict. However, when Argentina refused the US peace overtures, US Secretary\nof State Alexander Haig announced that the United States would prohibit arms\nsales to Argentina and provide material support for British operations. Both\nHouses of the US Congress passed resolutions supporting the US action siding\nwith the United Kingdom.[31]\n\nThe US provided the United Kingdom with military equipment ranging from\nsubmarine detectors to the latest missiles.[32][33][34][35] President Ronald\nReagan approved the Royal Navy's request to borrow the Sea Harrier-capable\namphibious assault ship USS\u00a0_Iwo Jima_\u00a0(LPH-2) if the British lost an aircraft\ncarrier. The United States Navy developed a plan to help the British man the\nship with American military contractors, likely retired sailors with knowledge\nof the _Iwo Jima_'s systems.[36] France provided dissimilar aircraft training\nso Harrier pilots could train against the French aircraft used by\nArgentina.[37] French and British intelligence also worked to prevent\nArgentina from obtaining more Exocet missiles on the international market,[38]\nwhile at the same time Peru attempted to purchase 12 missiles for Argentina,\nin a failed secret operation.[39][40] Chile gave support to Britain in the\nform of intelligence about the Argentine military and early warning\nintelligence on Argentine air movements.[41][42] Throughout the war, Argentina\nwas afraid of a Chilean military intervention in Patagonia and kept some of\nher best mountain regiments away from the Falklands near the Chilean border as\na precaution.[43]\n\nIn recent years, it has become known that a listening post located in Fauske,\nNorway was vital in giving the British intelligence information regarding\nArgentine fleet locations. The listening post was designated Fauske II by\nNorway. The information was \"stolen\" from Soviet spy satellites, which were\nthe only space assets that covered the South Atlantic.[44] Western powers such\nas the United States and the UK did not have their own satellite presence in\nthis area at the time. A high ranking British military source claimed that the\nintelligence the British got from the Fauske II post as \"Incredibly vital\":\n\n> When the war broke out, we had almost no intelligence information from this\narea. It was here we got help from the Norwegians, who gave us a stream of\ninformation about the Argentinian warships positions. The information came to\nus all the time and straight to our war headquarters at Northwood. The\ninformation was continuously updated and told us exactly where the Argentinian\nships were.[44][45]\n\nWhile France overtly backed the United Kingdom, a French technical team\nremained in Argentina throughout the war. French government sources have said\nthat the French team was engaged in intelligence-gathering; however, it\nsimultaneously provided direct material support to the Argentines, identifying\nand fixing faults in Exocet missile launchers.[46] According to the book\n_Operation Israel_, advisers from Israel Aerospace Industries were already in\nArgentina and continued their work during the conflict. The book also claims\nthat Israel sold weapons and drop tanks in a secret operation in Peru.[47][48]\nPeru also openly sent \"Mirages, pilots and missiles\" to Argentina during the\nwar.[49] Peru had earlier transferred ten Hercules transport planes to\nArgentina soon after the British Task Force had set sail in April 1982.[50]\nNick van der Bijl records that, after the Argentine defeat at Goose Green,\nVenezuela and Guatemala offered to send paratroops to the Falklands.[51]\nThrough Libya, under Muammar Gaddafi, Argentina received 20 launchers and 60\nSA-7 missiles, as well as machine guns, mortars and mines; all in all, the\nload of four trips of two Boeing 707s of the AAF, refuelled in Recife with the\nknowledge and consent of the Brazilian government.[52] Some of these\nclandestine logistics operations were mounted by the Soviet Union.[53]\n\n## British Task Force[edit]\n\nMain article: British logistics in the Falklands War\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/HMS_Invincible_%28R05%\n29_Norfolk.jpg/220px-HMS_Invincible_%28R05%29_Norfolk.jpg)\n\nHMS\u00a0_Invincible_, part of the task force.

The gloss paint scheme was altered\nto a duller one en route south.\n\nThe British government had no contingency plan for an invasion of the islands,\nand the task force was rapidly put together from whatever vessels were\navailable.[54] The nuclear submarine _Conqueror_ set sail from France on 4\nApril, whilst the two aircraft carriers _Invincible_ and _Hermes_, in the\ncompany of escort vessels, left Portsmouth only a day later.[26] On its return\nto Southampton from a world cruise on 7 April, the ocean liner SS\u00a0_Canberra_\nwas requisitioned and set sail two days later with 3 Commando Brigade\naboard.[26] The ocean liner _Queen Elizabeth 2_ was also requisitioned and\nleft Southampton on 12 May with 5th Infantry Brigade on board.[26] The whole\ntask force eventually comprised 127 ships: 43 Royal Navy vessels, 22 Royal\nFleet Auxiliary ships and 62 merchant ships.[54]\n\nThe retaking of the Falkland Islands was considered extremely difficult. The\nUS Navy considered a successful counter-invasion \"...a military\nimpossibility.\"[55] Firstly, the British were significantly constrained by the\ndisparity in deployable air cover.[56] The British had 42 aircraft (28 Sea\nHarriers and 14 Harrier GR.3s) available for air combat operations,[57]\nagainst approximately 122 serviceable jet fighters, of which about 50 were\nused as air superiority fighters and the remainder as strike aircraft, in\nArgentina's air forces during the war.[58] Crucially, the British lacked\nAirborne early warning and control (AEW) aircraft. Planning also considered\nthe Argentine surface fleet and the threat posed by Exocet-equipped vessels or\nthe two Type 209 submarines.[59]\n\nBy mid-April, the Royal Air Force had set up the airbase of RAF Ascension\nIsland, co-located with Wideawake Airfield (USA) on the mid-Atlantic British\noverseas territory of Ascension Island, including a sizeable force of Avro\nVulcan B Mk 2 bombers, Handley Page Victor K Mk 2 refuelling aircraft, and\nMcDonnell Douglas Phantom FGR Mk 2 fighters to protect them. Meanwhile, the\nmain British naval task force arrived at Ascension to prepare for active\nservice. A small force had already been sent south to recapture South Georgia.\n\nEncounters began in April; the British Task Force was shadowed by Boeing 707\naircraft of the Argentine Air Force during their travel to the south.[60]\nSeveral of these flights were intercepted by Sea Harriers outside the British-\nimposed exclusion zone; the unarmed 707s were not attacked because diplomatic\nmoves were still in progress and the UK had not yet decided to commit itself\nto armed force. On 23 April, a Brazilian commercial Douglas DC-10 from VARIG\nAirlines en route to South Africa was intercepted by British Harriers who\nvisually identified the civilian plane.[61]\n\n### Recapture of South Georgia and the attack on _Santa Fe_[edit]\n\nThe South Georgia force, _Operation Paraquet_, under the command of Major Guy\nSheridan RM, consisted of Marines from 42 Commando, a troop of the Special Air\nService (SAS) and Special Boat Service (SBS) troops who were intended to land\nas reconnaissance forces for an invasion by the Royal Marines. All were\nembarked on RFA _Tidespring_. First to arrive was the _Churchill_-class\nsubmarine HMS _Conqueror_ on 19 April, and the island was over-flown by a\nradar-mapping Handley Page Victor on 20 April.\n\nThe first landings of SAS troops took place on 21 April, but\u2014with the southern\nhemisphere autumn setting in\u2014the weather was so bad that their landings and\nothers made the next day were all withdrawn after two helicopters crashed in\nfog on Fortuna Glacier. On 23 April, a submarine alert was sounded and\noperations were halted, with _Tidespring_ being withdrawn to deeper water to\navoid interception. On 24 April, the British forces regrouped and headed in to\nattack.\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/USS_Catfish%3B0833910.\njpg/200px-USS_Catfish%3B0833910.jpg)\n\nThe _ARA Santa Fe_ sailing on the surface.\n\nOn 25 April, after resupplying the Argentine garrison in South Georgia, the\nsubmarine ARA _Santa Fe_ was spotted on the surface[62] by a Westland Wessex\nHAS Mk 3 helicopter from HMS\u00a0_Antrim_, which attacked the Argentine submarine\nwith depth charges. HMS\u00a0_Plymouth_ launched a Westland Wasp HAS.Mk.1\nhelicopter, and HMS\u00a0_Brilliant_ launched a Westland Lynx HAS Mk 2. The Lynx\nlaunched a torpedo, and strafed the submarine with its pintle-mounted general\npurpose machine gun; the Wessex also fired on _Santa Fe_ with its GPMG. The\nWasp from HMS\u00a0_Plymouth_ as well as two other Wasps launched from HMS\n_Endurance_ fired AS-12 ASM antiship missiles at the submarine, scoring hits.\n_Santa Fe_ was damaged badly enough to prevent her from diving. The crew\nabandoned the submarine at the jetty at King Edward Point on South Georgia.\n\nWith _Tidespring_ now far out to sea, and the Argentine forces augmented by\nthe submarine's crew, Major Sheridan decided to gather the 76 men he had and\nmake a direct assault that day. After a short forced march by the British\ntroops and a naval bombardment demonstration by two Royal Navy vessels\n(_Antrim_ and _Plymouth_), the Argentine forces surrendered without\nresistance. The message sent from the naval force at South Georgia to London\nwas, \"Be pleased to inform Her Majesty that the White Ensign flies alongside\nthe Union Jack in South Georgia. God Save the Queen.\" The Prime Minister,\nMargaret Thatcher, broke the news to the media, telling them to \"Just rejoice\nat that news, and congratulate our forces and the Marines!\"[63]\n\n### Black Buck raids[edit]\n\nMain article: Operation Black Buck\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Avro_Vulcan_Bomber_RAF\n.JPEG/220px-Avro_Vulcan_Bomber_RAF.JPEG)\n\nRAF Avro Vulcan B.Mk.2 strategic bomber\n\nOn 1 May, British operations on the Falklands opened with the \"Black Buck 1\"\nattack (of a series of five) on the airfield at Stanley. A Vulcan bomber from\nAscension flew on an 8,000-nautical-mile (15,000\u00a0km; 9,200\u00a0mi) round trip\ndropping conventional bombs across the runway at Stanley and back to\nAscension. The mission required repeated refuelling, and required several\nVictor tanker aircraft operating in concert, including tanker to tanker\nrefuelling. The overall effect of the raids on the war is difficult to\ndetermine, and the raids consumed precious tanker resources from\nAscension,[64] but also prevented Argentina from stationing fast jets on the\nislands.\n\nThe raids did minimal damage to the runway, and damage to radars was quickly\nrepaired. As of 2014[update] the Royal Air Force Web site still states that\nall the three bombing missions had been successful,[65] but historian Lawrence\nFreedman, who had access to classified documents, said in a 2005 book that the\nsubsequent bombing missions were failures.[66] Argentine sources said that the\nVulcan raids influenced Argentina to withdraw some of its Mirage IIIs from\nSouthern Argentina to the Buenos Aires Defence Zone.[67][68][69] This was\nlater described as propaganda by Falklands veteran Commander Nigel Ward.[70]\nIn any case, the effect of the Vulcan raids on Argentina's deployment of\ndefensive fighters was watered down when British officials made clear that\nthere would be no strikes on air bases in Argentina.[71]\n\nOf the five Black Buck raids, three were against Stanley Airfield, with the\nother two anti-radar missions using Shrike anti-radiation missiles.\n\n### Escalation of the air war[edit]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Super_Etendard_ARA_204\n.jpg/220px-Super_Etendard_ARA_204.jpg)\n\nFrench-built Super \u00c9tendard of the Argentine Naval Aviation\n\nThe Falklands had only three airfields. The longest and only paved runway was\nat the capital, Stanley, and even that was too short to support fast jets\n(although an arrestor gear was fitted in April to support Skyhawks).\nTherefore, the Argentines were forced to launch their major strikes from the\nmainland, severely hampering their efforts at forward staging, combat air\npatrols and close air support over the islands. The effective loiter time of\nincoming Argentine aircraft was low, and they were later compelled to overfly\nBritish forces in any attempt to attack the islands.\n\nThe first major Argentine strike force comprised 36 aircraft (A-4 Skyhawks,\nIAI Daggers, English Electric Canberras, and Mirage III escorts), and was sent\non 1 May, in the belief that the British invasion was imminent or landings had\nalready taken place. Only a section of Grupo 6 (flying IAI Dagger aircraft)\nfound ships, which were firing at Argentine defences near the islands. The\nDaggers managed to attack the ships and return safely. This greatly boosted\nmorale of the Argentine pilots, who now knew they could survive an attack\nagainst modern warships, protected by radar ground clutter from the Islands\nand by using a late pop up profile. Meanwhile, other Argentine aircraft were\nintercepted by BAE Sea Harriers operating from HMS\u00a0_Invincible_. A Dagger[72]\nand a Canberra were shot down.\n\nCombat broke out between Sea Harrier FRS Mk 1 fighters of No. 801 Naval Air\nSquadron and Mirage III fighters of Grupo 8. Both sides refused to fight at\nthe other's best altitude, until two Mirages finally descended to engage. One\nwas shot down by an AIM-9L Sidewinder air-to-air missile (AAM), while the\nother escaped but was damaged and without enough fuel to return to its\nmainland air base. The plane made for Stanley, where it fell victim to\nfriendly fire from the Argentine defenders.[73]\n\nAs a result of this experience, Argentine Air Force staff decided to employ\nA-4 Skyhawks and Daggers only as strike units, the Canberras only during the\nnight, and Mirage IIIs (without air refuelling capability or any capable AAM)\nas decoys to lure away the British Sea Harriers. The decoying would be later\nextended with the formation of the Escuadr\u00f3n F\u00e9nix, a squadron of civilian\njets flying 24 hours-a-day simulating strike aircraft preparing to attack the\nfleet. On one of these flights, an Air Force Learjet was shot down, killing\nthe squadron commander, Vice Commodore Rodolfo De La Colina, the highest-\nranking Argentine officer to die in the war.[74][75] Stanley was used as an\nArgentine strongpoint throughout the conflict. Despite the Black Buck and\nHarrier raids on Stanley airfield (no fast jets were stationed there for air\ndefence) and overnight shelling by detached ships, it was never out of action\nentirely. Stanley was defended by a mixture of surface-to-air missile (SAM)\nsystems (Franco-German Roland and British Tigercat) and Swiss-built Oerlikon\n35 mm twin anti-aircraft cannons. Lockheed Hercules transport night flights\nbrought supplies, weapons, vehicles, and fuel, and airlifted out the wounded\nup until the end of the conflict.\n\nThe only Argentine Hercules shot down by the British was lost on 1 June when\nTC-63 was intercepted by a Sea Harrier in daylight[76][77] when it was\nsearching for the British fleet north-east of the islands after the Argentine\nNavy retired its last SP-2H Neptune due to airframe attrition.\n\nVarious options to attack the home base of the five Argentine Etendards at R\u00edo\nGrande were examined and discounted (Operation Mikado), subsequently five\nRoyal Navy submarines lined up, submerged, on the edge of Argentina's 12\n-nautical-mile (22\u00a0km; 14\u00a0mi) territorial limit to provide early warning of\nbombing raids on the British task force.[78]\n\n### Sinking of ARA _General Belgrano_[edit]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/ARA_Belgrano_1982.PNG\n/220px-ARA_Belgrano_1982.PNG)\n\nARA Belgrano.\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/ARA_Alf%C3%A9rez_Sobra\nl_%28A-9%29.jpg/220px-ARA_Alf%C3%A9rez_Sobral_%28A-9%29.jpg)\n\nAlferez Sobral\n\nTwo British naval task forces (one of surface vessels and one of submarines)\nand the Argentine fleet were operating in the neighbourhood of the Falklands\nand soon came into conflict. The first naval loss was the World War II-vintage\nArgentine light cruiser ARA _General Belgrano_. The nuclear-powered submarine\nHMS _Conqueror_ sank _General Belgrano_ on 2 May. Three hundred and twenty-\nthree members of _General Belgrano_'s crew died in the incident. Over 700 men\nwere rescued from the open ocean despite cold seas and stormy weather. The\nlosses from _General Belgrano_ totalled nearly half of the Argentine deaths in\nthe Falklands conflict and the loss of the ship hardened the stance of the\nArgentine government.\n\nRegardless of controversies over the sinking, due to disagreement on the exact\nnature of the Maritime Exclusion Zone and whether _General Belgrano_ had been\nreturning to port at the time of the sinking, it had a crucial strategic\neffect: the elimination of the Argentine naval threat. After her loss, the\nentire Argentine fleet, with the exception of the conventional submarine ARA\n_San Luis_,[62] returned to port and did not leave again during the fighting.\nThe two escorting destroyers and the battle group centred on the aircraft\ncarrier ARA _Veinticinco de Mayo_ both withdrew from the area, ending the\ndirect threat to the British fleet that their pincer movement had represented.\n\nIn a separate incident later that night, British forces engaged an Argentine\npatrol gunboat, the ARA _Alferez Sobral_, that was searching for the crew of\nthe Argentine Air Force Canberra light bomber shot down on 1 May. Two Royal\nNavy Lynx helicopters fired four Sea Skua missiles at her. Badly damaged and\nwith eight crew dead, _Alferez Sobral_ managed to return to Puerto Deseado two\ndays later. The Canberra's crew were never found.\n\n### Sinking of HMS _Sheffield_[edit]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/HMS_Sheffield_%28D80%2\n9.jpg/200px-HMS_Sheffield_%28D80%29.jpg)\n\nHMS Sheffield\n\nOn 4 May, two days after the sinking of _General Belgrano_, the British lost\nthe Type 42 destroyer HMS\u00a0_Sheffield_ to fire following an Exocet missile\nstrike from the Argentine 2nd Naval Air Fighter/Attack Squadron. _Sheffield_\nhad been ordered forward with two other Type 42s to provide a long-range radar\nand medium-high altitude missile picket far from the British carriers. She was\nstruck amidships, with devastating effect, ultimately killing 20 crew members\nand severely injuring 24 others. The ship was abandoned several hours later,\ngutted and deformed by the fires that continued to burn for six more days. She\nfinally sank outside the Maritime Exclusion Zone on 10 May.\n\nThe incident is described in detail by Admiral Sandy Woodward in his book _One\nHundred Days_, Chapter One. Woodward was a former commanding officer of\n_Sheffield_.[79]\n\nThe tempo of operations increased throughout the second half of May as the\nUnited Nations' attempts to mediate a peace were rejected by the British, who\nfelt that any delay would make a campaign impractical in the South Atlantic\nstorms. The destruction of _Sheffield_ (the first Royal Navy ship sunk in\naction since World War II) had a profound impact on the British public,\nbringing home the fact that the \"Falklands Crisis\", as the BBC News put it,\nwas now an actual \"shooting war\".\n\n### British special forces operations[edit]\n\nGiven the threat to the British fleet posed by the Etendard-Exocet\ncombination, plans were made to use C-130s to fly in some SAS troops to attack\nthe home base of the five Etendards at R\u00edo Grande, Tierra del Fuego. The\noperation was codenamed \"Mikado.\" The operation was later scrapped, after\nacknowledging that its chances of success were limited, and replaced with a\nplan to use HMS _Onyx_ to drop SAS operatives several miles offshore at night\nfor them to make their way to the coast aboard rubber inflatables and proceed\nto destroy Argentina's remaining Exocet stockpile.[80]\n\nAn SAS reconnaissance team was dispatched to carry out preparations for a\nseaborne infiltration. A Westland Sea King helicopter carrying the assigned\nteam took off from HMS _Invincible_ on the night of 17 May, but bad weather\nforced it to land 50 miles (80\u00a0km) from its target and the mission was\naborted.[81] The pilot flew to Chile, landed south of Punta Arenas, and\ndropped off the SAS team. The helicopter's crew of three then destroyed the\naircraft, surrendered to Chilean police on 25 May, and were repatriated to the\nUK after interrogation. The discovery of the burnt-out helicopter attracted\nconsiderable international attention. Meanwhile, the SAS team crossed and\npenetrated deep into Argentina, but cancelled their mission after the\nArgentines suspected an SAS operation and deployed some 2,000 troops to search\nfor them. The SAS men were able to return to Chile, and took a civilian flight\nback to the UK.[82]\n\nOn 14 May the SAS carried out a raid on Pebble Island on the Falklands, where\nthe Argentine Navy had taken over a grass airstrip map for FMA IA 58 Pucar\u00e1\nlight ground-attack aircraft and Beechcraft T-34 Mentors, which resulted in\nthe destruction of several aircraft.[nb 4]\n\n## Land battles[edit]\n\n### Landing at San Carlos\u2014Bomb Alley[edit]\n\nMain articles: Operation Sutton and Battle of San Carlos\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Action_stations_Falkla\nnds_1982.JPG/170px-Action_stations_Falklands_1982.JPG)\n\nBritish sailors in anti-flash gear at action stations on HMS\u00a0_Cardiff_ near\nSan Carlos, June 1982.\n\nDuring the night of 21 May, the British Amphibious Task Group under the\ncommand of Commodore Michael Clapp (Commodore, Amphibious Warfare \u2013 COMAW)\nmounted _Operation Sutton_, the amphibious landing on beaches around San\nCarlos Water,[nb 5] on the northwestern coast of East Falkland facing onto\nFalkland Sound. The bay, known as _Bomb Alley_ by British forces, was the\nscene of repeated air attacks by low-flying Argentine jets.[83][84]\n\nThe 4,000 men of 3 Commando Brigade were put ashore as follows: 2nd Battalion,\nParachute Regiment (2 Para) from the RORO ferry _Norland_ and 40 Commando\nRoyal Marines from the amphibious ship HMS\u00a0_Fearless_ were landed at San\nCarlos (Blue Beach), 3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment (3 Para) from the\namphibious ship HMS\u00a0_Intrepid_ was landed at Port San Carlos (Green Beach) and\n45 Commando from RFA _Stromness_ was landed at Ajax Bay (Red Beach). Notably,\nthe waves of eight LCUs and eight LCVPs were led by Major Ewen Southby-\nTailyour, who had commanded the Falklands detachment NP8901 from March 1978 to\n1979. 42 Commando on the ocean liner SS\u00a0_Canberra_ was a tactical reserve.\nUnits from the Royal Artillery, Royal Engineers, etc. and armoured\nreconnaissance vehicles were also put ashore with the landing craft, the Round\nTable class LSL and mexeflote barges. Rapier missile launchers were carried as\nunderslung loads of Sea Kings for rapid deployment.\n\nBy dawn the next day, they had established a secure beachhead from which to\nconduct offensive operations. From there, Brigadier Julian Thompson's plan was\nto capture Darwin and Goose Green before turning towards Port Stanley. Now,\nwith the British troops on the ground, the Argentine Air Force began the night\nbombing campaign against them using Canberra bomber planes until the last day\nof the war (14 June).\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/HMS_Antelope_1982.jpg\n/220px-HMS_Antelope_1982.jpg)\n\nHMS\u00a0_Antelope_ smoking after being hit, 23 May\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/HMS_Coventry_D118.jpg\n/220px-HMS_Coventry_D118.jpg)\n\nHMS Coventry.\n\nAt sea, the paucity of the British ships' anti-aircraft defences was\ndemonstrated in the sinking of HMS\u00a0_Ardent_ on 21 May, HMS\u00a0_Antelope_ on 24\nMay, and MV _Atlantic Conveyor_ (struck by two AM39 Exocets) on 25 May along\nwith a vital cargo of helicopters, runway-building equipment and tents. The\nloss of all but one of the Chinook helicopters being carried by the Atlantic\nConveyor was a severe blow from a logistical perspective.\n\nAlso lost on this day was HMS\u00a0_Coventry_, a sister to _Sheffield_, whilst in\ncompany with HMS\u00a0_Broadsword_ after being ordered to act as a decoy to draw\naway Argentine aircraft from other ships at San Carlos Bay.[85] HMS\u00a0_Argonaut_\nand HMS\u00a0_Brilliant_ were badly damaged. However, many British ships escaped\nbeing sunk because of weaknesses of the Argentine pilots' bombing tactics\ndescribed below.\n\nTo avoid the highest concentration of British air defences, Argentine pilots\nreleased ordnance from very low altitude, and hence their bomb fuzes did not\nhave sufficient time to arm before impact. The low release of the retarded\nbombs (some of which the British had sold to the Argentines years earlier)\nmeant that many never exploded, as there was insufficient time in the air for\nthem to arm themselves. A simple free-fall bomb in a low altitude release,\nimpacts almost directly below the aircraft, which is then within the lethal\nfragmentation zone of the explosion.\n\nA retarded bomb has a small parachute or air brake that opens to reduce the\nspeed of the bomb to produce a safe horizontal separation between the two. The\nfuze for a retarded bomb requires that the retarder be open a minimum time to\nensure safe separation. The pilots would have been aware of this\u2014but due to\nthe high concentration required to avoid SAMs, Anti-Aircraft Artillery (AAA),\nand British Sea Harriers, many failed to climb to the necessary release point.\nThe Argentine forces solved the problem by fitting improvised retarding\ndevices, allowing the pilots to effectively employ low-level bombing attacks\non 8 June.\n\nIn his autobiographical account of the Falklands War, Admiral Woodward blamed\nthe BBC World Service for disclosing information that led the Argentines to\nchange the retarding devices on the bombs. The World Service reported the lack\nof detonations after receiving a briefing on the matter from a Ministry of\nDefence official. He describes the BBC as being more concerned with being\n\"fearless seekers after truth\" than with the lives of British servicemen.[86]\nColonel 'H'. Jones levelled similar accusations against the BBC after they\ndisclosed the impending British attack on Goose Green by 2 Para.\n\nThirteen bombs hit British ships without detonating.[87] Lord Craig, the\nretired Marshal of the Royal Air Force, is said to have remarked: \"Six better\nfuses and we would have lost\"[88] although _Ardent_ and _Antelope_ were both\nlost despite the failure of bombs to explode. The fuzes were functioning\ncorrectly, and the bombs were simply released from too low an altitude.[86]\n[89] The Argentines lost 22 aircraft in the attacks.[nb 6]\n\n### Battle of Goose Green[edit]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Land.ops.2.en.svg\n/480px-Land.ops.2.en.svg.png)\n\nInfantry deployment in East Falklands after landing in San Carlos\n\nMain article: Battle of Goose Green\n\nFrom early on 27 May until 28 May, 2 Para, (approximately 500 men) with\nartillery support from 8 (Alma) Commando Battery, Royal Artillery, approached\nand attacked Darwin and Goose Green, which was held by the Argentine 12th\nInfantry Regiment. After a tough struggle that lasted all night and into the\nnext day, the British won the battle; in all, 17 British and 47 Argentine\nsoldiers were killed. In total 961 Argentine troops (including 202 Argentine\nAir Force personnel of the _Condor_ airfield) were taken prisoner.\n\nThe BBC announced the taking of Goose Green on the BBC World Service before it\nhad actually happened. It was during this attack that Lieutenant Colonel H.\nJones, the commanding officer of 2 Para, was killed at the head of his\nbattalion while charging into the well-prepared Argentine positions. He was\nposthumously awarded the Victoria Cross.\n\nWith the sizeable Argentine force at Goose Green out of the way, British\nforces were now able to break out of the San Carlos beachhead. On 27 May, men\nof 45 Cdo and 3 Para started a loaded march across East Falkland towards the\ncoastal settlement of Teal Inlet.\n\n### Special forces on Mount Kent[edit]\n\nMeanwhile, 42 Commando prepared to move by helicopter to Mount Kent.[nb 7]\nUnknown to senior British officers, the Argentine generals were determined to\ntie down the British troops in the Mount Kent area, and on 27 and 28 May they\nsent transport aircraft loaded with Blowpipe surface-to-air missiles and\ncommandos (602nd Commando Company and 601st National Gendarmerie Special\nForces Squadron) to Stanley. This operation was known as Operation\nAUTOIMPUESTA (Self-Determination-Initiative).\n\nFor the next week, the SAS and the Mountain and Arctic Warfare Cadre\n(M&amp;AWC) of 3 Commando Brigade waged intense patrol battles with patrols of\nthe volunteers' 602nd Commando Company under Major Aldo Rico, normally 2nd in\nCommand of the 22nd Mountain Infantry Regiment. Throughout 30 May, Royal Air\nForce Harriers were active over Mount Kent. One of them, Harrier _XZ963_,\nflown by Squadron Leader Jerry Pook\u2014in responding to a call for help from D\nSquadron, attacked Mount Kent's eastern lower slopes, and that led to its loss\nthrough small-arms fire. Pook was subsequently awarded the Distinguished\nFlying Cross.[90]\n\nThe Argentine Navy used their last AM39 Exocet missile attempting to attack\nHMS\u00a0_Invincible_ on 30 May. There are Argentine claims that the missile\nstruck;[91][92] however, the British have denied this, some citing that HMS\n_Avenger_ shot it down.[93][94] When _Invincible_ returned to the UK after the\nwar, she showed no signs of missile damage.\n\nOn 31 May, the M&amp;AWC defeated Argentine Special Forces at the Battle of\nTop Malo House. A 13-strong Argentine Army Commando detachment (Captain Jos\u00e9\nVercesi's 1st Assault Section, 602nd Commando Company) found itself trapped in\na small shepherd's house at Top Malo. The Argentine commandos fired from\nwindows and doorways and then took refuge in a stream bed 200 metres (700\u00a0ft)\nfrom the burning house. Completely surrounded, they fought 19 M&amp;AWC\nmarines under Captain Rod Boswell for 45 minutes until, with their ammunition\nalmost exhausted, they elected to surrender.\n\nThree Cadre members were badly wounded. On the Argentine side, there were two\ndead, including Lieutenant Ernesto Espinoza and Sergeant Mateo Sbert (who were\nposthumously decorated for their bravery). Only five Argentines were left\nunscathed. As the British mopped up Top Malo House, Lieutenant Fraser Haddow's\nM&amp;AWC patrol came down from Malo Hill, brandishing a large Union Flag. One\nwounded Argentine soldier, Lieutenant Horacio Losito, commented that their\nescape route would have taken them through Haddow's position.\n\n601st Commando tried to move forward to rescue 602nd Commando Company on\nEstancia Mountain. Spotted by 42 Commando, they were engaged with 81mm mortars\nand forced to withdraw to Two Sisters mountain. The leader of 602nd Commando\nCompany on Estancia Mountain realised his position had become untenable and\nafter conferring with fellow officers ordered a withdrawal.[95]\n\nThe Argentine operation also saw the extensive use of helicopter support to\nposition and extract patrols; the 601st Combat Aviation Battalion also\nsuffered casualties. At about 11.00\u00a0am on 30 May, an Aerospatiale SA-330 Puma\nhelicopter was brought down by a shoulder-launched Stinger surface-to-air\nmissile (SAM) fired by the SAS in the vicinity of Mount Kent. Six National\nGendarmerie Special Forces were killed and eight more wounded in the\ncrash.[96]\n\nAs Brigadier Thompson commented, \"It was fortunate that I had ignored the\nviews expressed by Northwood HQ that reconnaissance of Mount Kent before\ninsertion of 42 Commando was superfluous. Had D Squadron not been there, the\nArgentine Special Forces would have caught the Commando before de-planing and,\nin the darkness and confusion on a strange landing zone, inflicted heavy\ncasualties on men and helicopters.\"[97]\n\n### Bluff Cove and Fitzroy[edit]\n\nMain article: Bluff Cove Air Attacks\n\nBy 1 June, with the arrival of a further 5,000 British troops of the 5th\nInfantry Brigade, the new British divisional commander, Major General Jeremy\nMoore RM, had sufficient force to start planning an offensive against Stanley.\nDuring this build-up, the Argentine air assaults on the British naval forces\ncontinued, killing 56. Of the dead, 32 were from the Welsh Guards on RFA _Sir\nGalahad_ and RFA _Sir Tristram_ on 8 June. According to Surgeon-Commander Rick\nJolly of the Falklands Field Hospital, more than 150 men suffered burns and\ninjuries of some kind in the attack, including, famously, Simon Weston.[98]\n\nThe Guards were sent to support an advance along the southern approach to\nStanley. On 2 June, a small advance party of 2 Para moved to Swan Inlet house\nin a number of Army Westland Scout helicopters. Telephoning ahead to Fitzroy,\nthey discovered that the area was clear of Argentines and (exceeding their\nauthority) commandeered the one remaining RAF Chinook helicopter to\nfrantically ferry another contingent of 2 Para ahead to Fitzroy (a settlement\non Port Pleasant) and Bluff Cove (a settlement on Port Fitzroy).\n\nThis uncoordinated advance caused great difficulties in planning for the\ncommanders of the combined operation, as they now found themselves with a 30\nmiles (48\u00a0km) string of indefensible positions on their southern flank.\nSupport could not be sent by air as the single remaining Chinook was already\nheavily oversubscribed. The soldiers could march, but their equipment and\nheavy supplies would need to be ferried by sea.\n\nPlans were drawn up for half the Welsh Guards to march light on the night of 2\nJune, whilst the Scots Guards and the second half of the Welsh Guards were to\nbe ferried from San Carlos Water in the Landing Ship Logistics (LSL) _Sir\nTristram_ and the landing platform dock (LPD) _Intrepid_ on the night of 5\nJune. _Intrepid_ was planned to stay one day and unload itself and as much of\n_Sir Tristram_ as possible, leaving the next evening for the relative safety\nof San Carlos. Escorts would be provided for this day, after which _Sir\nTristram_ would be left to unload using a Mexeflote (a powered raft) for as\nlong as it took to finish.\n\nPolitical pressure from above to not risk the LPD forced Commodore Clapp to\nalter this plan. Two lower-value LSLs would be sent, but with no suitable\nbeaches to land on, _Intrepid_'s landing craft would need to accompany them to\nunload. A complicated operation across several nights with _Intrepid_ and her\nsister ship _Fearless_ sailing half-way to dispatch their craft was devised.\n\nThe attempted overland march by half the Welsh Guards failed, possibly as they\nrefused to march light and attempted to carry their equipment. They returned\nto San Carlos and landed directly at Bluff Cove when _Fearless_ dispatched her\nlanding craft. _Sir Tristram_ sailed on the night of 6 June and was joined by\n_Sir Galahad_ at dawn on 7 June. Anchored 1,200 feet (370\u00a0m) apart in Port\nPleasant, the landing ships were near Fitzroy, the designated landing point.\n\nThe landing craft should have been able to unload the ships to that point\nrelatively quickly, but confusion over the ordered disembarcation point (the\nfirst half of the Guards going direct to Bluff Cove) resulted in the senior\nWelsh Guards infantry officer aboard insisting that his troops should be\nferried the far longer distance directly to Port Fitzroy/Bluff Cove. The\nalternative was for the infantrymen to march via the recently repaired Bluff\nCove bridge (destroyed by retreating Argentine combat engineers) to their\ndestination, a journey of around seven miles (11\u00a0km).\n\nOn _Sir Galahad_'s stern ramp there was an argument about what to do. The\nofficers on board were told that they could not sail to Bluff Cove that day.\nThey were told that they had to get their men off ship and onto the beach as\nsoon as possible as the ships were vulnerable to enemy aircraft. It would take\n20 minutes to transport the men to shore using the LCU and Mexeflote. They\nwould then have the choice of walking the seven miles to Bluff Cove or wait\nuntil dark to sail there. The officers on board said that they would remain on\nboard until dark and then sail. They refused to take their men off the ship.\nThey possibly doubted that the bridge had been repaired due to the presence on\nboard _Sir Galahad_ of the Royal Engineer Troop whose job it was to repair the\nbridge. The Welsh Guards were keen to rejoin the rest of their Battalion, who\nwere potentially facing the enemy without their support. They had also not\nseen any enemy aircraft since landing at San Carlos and may have been\noverconfident in the air defences. Ewen Southby-Tailyour gave a direct order\nfor the men to leave the ship and go to the beach. The order was ignored.\n\nThe longer journey time of the landing craft taking the troops directly to\nBluff Cove and the squabbling over how the landing was to be performed caused\nan enormous delay in unloading. This had disastrous consequences. Without\nescorts, having not yet established their air defence, and still almost fully\nladen, the two LSLs in Port Pleasant were sitting targets for two waves of\nArgentine A-4 Skyhawks.\n\nThe disaster at Port Pleasant (although often known as Bluff Cove) would\nprovide the world with some of the most sobering images of the war as TV news\nvideo footage showed Navy helicopters hovering in thick smoke to winch\nsurvivors from the burning landing ships.\n\nBritish casualties were 48 killed and 115 wounded.[99] Three Argentine pilots\nwere also killed. The air strike delayed the scheduled British ground attack\non Stanley by two days.[100] Argentine General Mario Menendez, commander of\nArgentine forces in the Falklands, was told that 900 British soldiers had\ndied. He expected that the losses would cause enemy morale to drop and the\nBritish assault to stall.\n\n### Fall of Stanley[edit]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Stanley.falklands.war.\nsvg/480px-Stanley.falklands.war.svg.png)\n\nThe road to Stanley\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2\n/Argentine_prisoners_of_war_-_Port_Stanley.JPG/220px-\nArgentine_prisoners_of_war_-_Port_Stanley.JPG)\n\nArgentine prisoners of war \u2013 Port Stanley.\n\nOn the night of 11 June, after several days of painstaking reconnaissance and\nlogistic build-up, British forces launched a brigade-sized night attack\nagainst the heavily defended ring of high ground surrounding Stanley. Units of\n3 Commando Brigade, supported by naval gunfire from several Royal Navy ships,\nsimultaneously attacked in the Battle of Mount Harriet, Battle of Two Sisters,\nand Battle of Mount Longdon. Mount Harriet was taken at a cost of 2 British\nand 18 Argentine soldiers. At Two Sisters, the British faced both enemy\nresistance and friendly fire, but managed to capture their objectives. The\ntoughest battle was at Mount Longdon. British forces were bogged down by\nassault rifle, mortar, machine gun, artillery fire, sniper fire, and ambushes.\nDespite this, the British continued their advance.\n\nDuring this battle, 13 were killed when HMS\u00a0_Glamorgan_, straying too close to\nshore while returning from the gun line, was struck by an improvised trailer-\nbased Exocet MM38 launcher taken from the destroyer ARA _Segu\u00ed_ by Argentine\nNavy technicians.[101] On the same day, Sergeant Ian McKay of 4 Platoon, B\nCompany, 3 Para died in a grenade attack on an Argentine bunker, which earned\nhim a posthumous Victoria Cross. After a night of fierce fighting, all\nobjectives were secured. Both sides suffered heavy losses.\n\nThe night of 13 June saw the start of the second phase of attacks, in which\nthe momentum of the initial assault was maintained. 2 Para, with light armour\nsupport from The Blues and Royals, captured Wireless Ridge, with the loss of 3\nBritish and 25 Argentine lives, and the 2nd battalion, Scots Guards captured\nMount Tumbledown at the Battle of Mount Tumbledown, which cost 10 British and\n30 Argentine lives.\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Discarded_weapons%2C_S\ntanley_1982.JPG/220px-Discarded_weapons%2C_Stanley_1982.JPG)\n\nA pile of discarded Argentine weapons in Port Stanley\n\nWith the last natural defence line at Mount Tumbledown breached, the Argentine\ntown defences of Stanley began to falter. In the morning gloom, one company\ncommander got lost and his junior officers became despondent. Private Santiago\nCarrizo of the 3rd Regiment described how a platoon commander ordered them to\ntake up positions in the houses and \"if a Kelper resists, shoot him\", but the\nentire company did nothing of the kind.[102]\n\nA ceasefire was declared on 14 June and the commander of the Argentine\ngarrison in Stanley, Brigade General Mario Men\u00e9ndez, surrendered to Major\nGeneral Jeremy Moore the same day.\n\nSee also: Argentine surrender in the Falklands War\n\n## Recapture of South Sandwich Islands[edit]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Thule1981.jpg/220px-\nThule1981.jpg)\n\nThe Argentine Thule Garrison at the Corbeta Uruguay base\n\nOn 20 June, the British retook the South Sandwich Islands (which involved\naccepting the surrender of the Southern Thule Garrison at the _Corbeta\nUruguay_ base), and declared hostilities over. Argentina had established\nCorbeta Uruguay in 1976, but prior to 1982 the United Kingdom had contested\nthe existence of the Argentine base only through diplomatic channels.\n\n## Casualties[edit]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Argentinegraveseastfal\nkland.jpg/220px-Argentinegraveseastfalkland.jpg)\n\nThe Argentine Military Cemetery, on East Falkland\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/San-Carlos-\nCemetery.JPG/220px-San-Carlos-Cemetery.JPG)\n\nThe British Military Cemetery at San Carlos on East Falkland\n\nIn total 907 were killed during the 74 days of the conflict:\n\n  * **Argentina** \u2013 649[103]\n    * Ej\u00e9rcito Argentino (_Army_) \u2013 194 (16 officers, 35 Non-commissioned officers (NCO) and 143 conscript privates)[104]\n    * Armada de la Rep\u00fablica Argentina (_Navy_) \u2013 341 (including 321 in _Belgrano_ and 4 naval aviators) \n      * IMARA ( _Marines_ ) \u2013 34[105]\n    * Fuerza A\u00e9rea Argentina (_Air Force_) \u2013 55 (including 31 pilots and 14 ground crew)[106]\n    * Gendarmer\u00eda Nacional Argentina (_Border Guard_) \u2013 7\n    * Prefectura Naval Argentina (_Coast Guard_) \u2013 2\n    * Civilian sailors \u2013 16\n  * **United Kingdom** \u2013 A total of 255 British servicemen and 3 female Falkland Island civilians were killed during the Falklands War.[107]\n    * Royal Navy \u2013 86 + 2 Hong Kong laundrymen (see below)[108]\n    * Royal Marines \u2013 27 (2 officers, 14 NCOs and 11 marines)[109]\n    * Royal Fleet Auxiliary \u2013 4 + 6 Hong Kong sailors[110][111]\n    * Merchant Navy \u2013 6[110]\n    * British Army \u2013 123 (7 officers, 40 NCOs and 76 privates)[112][113][114]\n    * Royal Air Force \u2013 1 (1 officer)[110]\n    * Falkland Islands civilians \u2013 3 women killed by friendly fire[110]\n\nOf the 86 Royal Navy personnel, 22 were lost in HMS\u00a0_Ardent_, 19 + 1 lost in\nHMS\u00a0_Sheffield_, 19 + 1 lost in HMS\u00a0_Coventry_ and 13 lost in HMS\u00a0_Glamorgan_.\nFourteen naval cooks were among the dead, the largest number from any one\nbranch in the Royal Navy.\n\nThirty-three of the British Army's dead came from the Welsh Guards, 21 from\nthe 3rd Battalion, the Parachute Regiment, 18 from the 2nd Battalion, the\nParachute Regiment, 19 from the Special Air Service, 3 from Royal Signals and\n8 from each of the Scots Guards and Royal Engineers.

Unsourced material may be challenged\nand removed. _(February 2014)_  \n---|---  \n  \nBefore British offensive operations began, the British and Argentine\ngovernments agreed to establish an area on the high seas where both sides\ncould station hospital ships without fear of attack by the other side. This\narea, a circle 20 nautical miles in diameter, was referred to as the Red Cross\nBox (48\u00b030\u2032S 53\u00b045\u2032W\ufeff / \ufeff48.500\u00b0S 53.750\u00b0W\ufeff / -48.500; -53.750), about 45\nmiles (72\u00a0km) north of Falkland Sound). Ultimately, the British stationed four\nships (HMS _Hydra_, HMS _Hecla_ and HMS _Herald_ and the primary hospital ship\n_Uganda_) within the box, while the Argentines stationed three (_Almirante\nIrizar_, _Bahia Paraiso_ and _Puerto Deseado_).\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/HMS_Hecla_1982_Gibralt\nar.jpg/220px-HMS_Hecla_1982_Gibraltar.jpg)\n\n_Hecla_ at HM Naval Base Gibraltar, during conversion to a hospital ship for\nservice during the Falklands War\n\nThe hospital ships were non-warships converted to serve as hospital ships. The\nthree British naval vessels were survey vessels and _Uganda_ was a passenger\nliner. _Almirante Irizar_ was an icebreaker, _Bahia Paraiso_ was an Antarctic\nsupply transport and _Puerto Deseado_ was a survey ship. The British and\nArgentine vessels operating within the Box were in radio contact and there was\nsome transfer of patients between the hospital ships. For example, the British\nhospital ship SS _Uganda_ on four occasions transferred patients to an\nArgentine hospital ship. The British naval hospital ships operated as casualty\nferries, carrying casualties from both sides from the Falklands to _Uganda_\nand operating a shuttle service between the Red Cross Box and Montevideo.\n\nThroughout the conflict officials of the International Committee of the Red\nCross (ICRC) conducted inspections to verify that all concerned were abiding\nby the rules of the Geneva Convention. On 12 June, some personnel transferred\nfrom the Argentine hospital ship to the British ships by helicopter. Argentine\nnaval officers also inspected the British casualty ferries in the estuary of\nthe River Plate.\n\n### British casualty evacuation[edit]\n\n_Hydra_ worked with _Hecla_ and _Herald_, to take casualties from _Uganda_ to\nMontevideo, Uruguay, where a fleet of Uruguayan ambulances would meet them.\nRAF VC10 aircraft then flew the casualties to the UK for transfer to the\nPrincess Alexandra Royal Air Force Hospital at RAF Wroughton, near\nSwindon.[_citation needed_]\n\n## Aftermath[edit]\n\nMain article: Aftermath of the Falklands War\n\nThis brief war brought many consequences for all the parties involved, besides\nthe considerable casualty rate and large materiel loss, especially of shipping\nand aircraft, relative to the deployed military strengths of the opposing\nsides.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Margaret Thatcher's popularity increased. The success\nof the Falklands campaign was widely regarded as the factor in the turnaround\nin fortunes for the Conservative government, who had been trailing behind the\nSDP-Liberal Alliance in the opinion polls for months before the conflict\nbegan, but after the success in the Falklands the Conservatives returned to\nthe top of the opinion polls by a wide margin and went on to win the following\nyear's general election by a landslide.[117] Subsequently, Defence Secretary\nNott's proposed cuts to the Royal Navy were abandoned.\n\nThe islanders subsequently had full British citizenship restored in 1983,\ntheir lifestyle improved by investments Britain made after the war and by the\nliberalisation of economic measures that had been stalled through fear of\nangering Argentina. In 1985, a new constitution was enacted promoting self-\ngovernment, which has continued to devolve power to the islanders.\n\nIn Argentina, the Falklands War meant that a possible war with Chile was\navoided. Further, Argentina returned to a democratic government in the 1983\ngeneral election, the first free general election since 1973. It also had a\nmajor social impact, destroying the military's image as the \"moral reserve of\nthe nation\" that they had maintained through most of the 20th century.\n\nVarious figures have been produced for the number of veterans who have\ncommitted suicide since the war. Some studies have estimated that 264 British\nveterans and 350\u2013500 Argentine veterans have committed suicide since\n1982.[118][119][120] However, a detailed study[121] of 21,432 British veterans\nof the war commissioned by the UK Ministry of Defence found that only 95 had\ndied from \"intentional self-harm and events of undetermined intent (suicides\nand open verdict deaths)\", a ratio no higher than that of the general\npopulation.[122]\n\n### Military analysis[edit]\n\nMilitarily, the Falklands conflict remains the largest air-naval combat\noperation between modern forces since the end of the Second World War. As\nsuch, it has been the subject of intense study by military analysts and\nhistorians. The most significant \"lessons learned\" include: the vulnerability\nof surface ships to anti-ship missiles and submarines, the challenges of co-\nordinating logistical support for a long-distance projection of power, and\nreconfirmation of the role of tactical air power, including the use of\nhelicopters.\n\nIn 1986, the BBC broadcast the _Horizon_ programme, _In the Wake of HMS\nSheffield_, which discussed lessons learned from the conflict\u2014and measures\nsince taken to implement them, such as stealth ships and close-in weapon\nsystems.\n\n### Memorials[edit]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Malvimasmemorial.jpg\n/220px-Malvimasmemorial.jpg)\n\nThe _Monumento a los Ca\u00eddos en Malvinas_ (\"Monument for the Fallen in the\nFalklands\") in Plaza San Mart\u00edn, Buenos Aires; a member of the historic\n_Patricios_ regiment stands guard.[nb 8]\n\nIn addition to memorials on the islands, there is a memorial in the crypt of\nSt Paul's Cathedral, London to the British war dead.[123] In Argentina, there\nis a memorial at Plaza San Mart\u00edn in Buenos Aires,[124] another one in\nRosario, and a third one in Ushuaia.\n\nDuring the war, British dead were put into plastic body bags and buried in\nmass graves. After the war, the bodies were recovered; 14 were reburied at\nBlue Beach Military Cemetery and 64 were returned to Britain.\n\nMany of the Argentine dead are buried in the Argentine Military Cemetery west\nof the Darwin Settlement. The government of Argentina declined an offer by\nBritain to have the bodies repatriated to the mainland.[125]\n\n### Minefields[edit]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Falklands-\nMinefield.JPG/220px-Falklands-Minefield.JPG)\n\nAlthough some minefields have been cleared, a substantial number of them still\nexist in the islands, such as this one at Port William on East Falkland.\n\nAs of 2011, there were 113 uncleared minefields on the Falkland Islands and\nunexploded ordnance (UXOs) covering an area of 13\u00a0km2 (5.0\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). Of this\narea, 5.5\u00a0km2 (2.1\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) on the Murrell Peninsula were classified as being\n\"suspected minefields\" \u2013 the area had been heavily pastured for the previous\n25 years without incident. It was estimated that these minefields had 20,000\nanti-personnel mines and 5,000 anti-tank mines. No human casualties from mines\nor UXO have been reported in the Falkland Islands since 1984, and no civilian\nmine casualties have ever occurred on the islands. The UK reported six\nmilitary personnel were injured in 1982 and a further two injured in 1983.\nMost military accidents took place while clearing the minefields in the\nimmediate aftermath of the 1982 conflict or in the process of trying to\nestablish the extent of the minefield perimeters, particularly where no\ndetailed records existed.\n\nOn 9 May 2008, the Falkland Islands Government asserted that the minefields,\nwhich represent 0.1% of the available farmland on the islands \"present no long\nterm social or economic difficulties for the Falklands,\" and that the impact\nof clearing the mines would cause more problems than containing them. However,\nthe British Government, in accordance with its commitments under the Mine Ban\nTreaty has a commitment to clear the mines by the end of 2019. [126][127] In\nMay 2012, it was announced that 3.7\u00a0km2 (1.4\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of Stanley Common (which\nlies between the Stanley \u2013 Mount Pleasant road and the shoreline) was made\nsafe and had been opened to the public, opening up a 3-kilometre (1.9\u00a0mi)\nstretch of coastline and a further two kilometres of shoreline along Mullet's\nCreek.[128]\n\n## Press and publicity[edit]\n\n### Argentina[edit]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9a/Gentemayo1982.jpg/220px-\nGentemayo1982.jpg)\n\n_Gente_'s \"Estamos ganando\" headline (\"We're winning\")\n\nSelected war correspondents were regularly flown to Port Stanley in military\naircraft to report on the war. Back in Buenos Aires, newspapers and magazines\nfaithfully reported on \"the heroic actions of the largely conscript army and\nits successes\".[17]\n\nOfficers from the intelligence services were attached to the newspapers and\n'leaked' information confirming the official communiqu\u00e9s from the government.\nThe glossy magazines _Gente_ and _Siete D\u00edas_ swelled to 60 pages with colour\nphotographs of British warships in flames \u2013 many of them faked \u2013 and bogus\neyewitness reports of the Argentine commandos' guerrilla war on South Georgia\n(6 May) and an already dead Pucar\u00e1 pilot's attack on HMS _Hermes_[17] (Lt.\nDaniel Antonio Jukic had been killed at Goose Green during a British air\nstrike on 1 May). Most of the faked photos actually came from the tabloid\npress. One of the best remembered headlines was \"Estamos ganando\" (\"We're\nwinning\") from the magazine _Gente_, that would later use variations of\nit.[129]\n\nThe Argentine troops on the Falkland Islands could read _Gaceta Argentina_\u2014a\nnewspaper intended to boost morale among the servicemen. Some of its untruths\ncould easily be unveiled by the soldiers who recovered corpses.[130]\n\nThe _Malvinas course_ united the Argentines in a patriotic atmosphere that\nprotected the junta from critics, and even opponents of the military\ngovernment supported Galtieri; Ernesto Sabato said: \"Don't be mistaken,\nEurope; it is not a dictatorship who is fighting for the Malvinas, it is the\nwhole Nation. Opponents of the military dictatorship, like me, are fighting to\nextirpate the last trace of colonialism.\"[131] The _Madres de Plaza de Mayo_\nwere even exposed to death threats from ordinary people.[17]\n\nHMS _Invincible_ was repeatedly sunk in the Argentine press,[132] and on 30\nApril 1982 the Argentine magazine _Tal Cual_ showed Prime Minister Thatcher\nwith an eyepatch and the text: _Pirate, witch and assassin. Guilty!_[133]\nThree British reporters sent to Argentina to cover the war from the Argentine\nperspective were jailed until the end of the war.[134]\n\n### United Kingdom[edit]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/58/The_Sun_%28Gotcha%29.png\n/220px-The_Sun_%28Gotcha%29.png)\n\n_The Sun_'s \"Gotcha\" headline\n\nSeventeen newspaper reporters, two photographers, two radio reporters and\nthree television reporters with five technicians sailed with the Task Force to\nthe war. The Newspaper Publishers' Association selected them from among 160\napplicants, excluding foreign media. The hasty selection resulted in the\ninclusion of two journalists among the war reporters who were interested only\nin Queen Elizabeth II's son Prince Andrew, who was serving in the\nconflict.[135] The Prince flew a helicopter on multiple missions, including\nanti-surface warfare, Exocet missile decoy and casualty evacuation.\n\nMerchant vessels had the civilian Inmarsat uplink, which enabled written telex\nand voice report transmissions via satellite. SS\u00a0_Canberra_ had a facsimile\nmachine that was used to upload 202 pictures from the South Atlantic over the\ncourse of the war. The Royal Navy leased bandwidth on the US Defense Satellite\nCommunications System for worldwide communications. Television demands a\nthousand times the data rate of telephone, but the Ministry of Defence was\nunsuccessful in convincing the US to allocate more bandwidth.[136]\n\nTV producers suspected that the enquiry was half-hearted; since the Vietnam\nWar television pictures of casualties and traumatised soldiers were recognised\nas having negative propaganda value. However, the technology only allowed\nuploading a single frame per 20 minutes \u2013 and only if the military satellites\nwere allocated 100% to television transmissions. Videotapes were shipped to\nAscension Island, where a broadband satellite uplink was available, resulting\nin TV coverage being delayed by three weeks.[136]\n\nThe press was very dependent on the Royal Navy, and was censored on site. Many\nreporters in the UK knew more about the war than those with the Task\nForce.[136]\n\nThe Royal Navy expected Fleet Street to conduct a Second World War-style\npositive news campaign[137] but the majority of the British media, especially\nthe BBC, reported the war in a neutral fashion.[138] These reporters referred\nto \"the British troops\" and \"the Argentinian troops\" instead of \"our lads\" and\nthe \"Argies\".[139] The two main tabloid papers presented opposing viewpoints:\n_The Daily Mirror_ was decidedly anti-war, whilst _The Sun_ became well known\nfor headlines such as \"Stick It Up Your Junta!,\" which, along with the\nreporting in other tabloids,[140] led to accusations of xenophobia[132]\n[140][141] and jingoism.[132] [141][142][143] _The Sun_ was condemned for its\n\"Gotcha\" headline following the sinking of the ARA _General\nBelgrano_.[144][145][146]\n\n## Cultural impact[edit]\n\nMain article: Cultural impact of the Falklands War\n\nThere were wide-ranging influences on popular culture in both the UK and\nArgentina, from the immediate postwar period to the present. The then elderly\nArgentine writer Jorge Luis Borges described the war as \"a fight between two\nbald men over a comb\".[147] The words _yomp_ and _Exocet_ entered the British\nvernacular as a result of the war. The Falklands War also provided material\nfor theatre, film and TV drama and influenced the output of musicians. In\nArgentina, the military government banned the broadcasting of music in the\nEnglish language, giving way to the rise of local rock musicians.[148]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Beagle conflict, a border dispute between Chile and Argentina that involved island territory.\n  * Operation Algeciras, a failed Argentine plan to send Montoneros to sabotage British military facilities in Gibraltar\n  * Operation Soberan\u00eda, plans for Argentina's invasion of Chile 1978 and later.\n  * Reassertion of British sovereignty over the Falkland Islands (1833)\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n  1. **^** 255 military personnel.[4]\n  2. **^**\n\n    * 2 April: 57 Royal Marines (RM), 11 Royal Navy (RN) and 23 Falkland Islands Defence Force (FIDF) members\n    * 3 April: 22 RM\n    * 21 May: 1 Royal Air Force (RAF) member\n    * 10 June: 1 Special Air Services (SAS) member.\n    * [_citation needed_]\n\n  3. **^** 633 military personnel and 16 civilian sailors.[5]\n  4. **^** 6 Pucaras, 4 T-34 Mentor and 1 Short Skyvan\n  5. **^** Location: \"Bomb Alley\"\u2002San Carlos Water,\u2002Falkland Islands\u2002(linkback://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falklands_War#Landing_at_San_Carlos.E2.80.94Bomb_Alley)\n  6. **^** 21/27 May: 9 Dagger, 5 A-4C, 3 A-4Q, 3 A-4B &amp; 2 Pucara\n  7. **^** Location: \"Mount Kent\"\u2002Mount Kent,\u2002Falkland Islands\u2002(linkback://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falklands_War#Special_forces_on_Mount_Kent)\n  8. **^** Buenos Aires War Memorial is at coordinates 34\u00b035\u203237\u2033S 58\u00b022\u203229\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff34.59373\u00b0S 58.374782\u00b0W\ufeff / -34.59373; -58.374782\ufeff (Buenos Aires War Memorial)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. **^** \"Falklands 25: Background Briefing\".

It stated that one of the Mirages lost on 1 May had collided with a Sea Harrier and the Argentine pilot survived. In fact Argentine AAA at Stanley shot down the Mirage when it tried an emergency landing there. It was a blatant lie for all those Argentine servicemen who had seen the Mirage being shot down by Argentine guns and had removed the dead pilot from the crashed aeroplane. Similarly, the junta's press office in Buenos Aires informed that Lieutenant Antonio Jukic, who actually was killed in his Pucar\u00e1 on the ground at Goose Green, had perished in a gallant, single-handed Pucar\u00e1 attack on HMS _Hermes_, setting it on fire. This statement was illustrated with dramatic sketches. The men at Goose Green knew that Lieutenant Jukic had died on the ground there.  \n_Gaceta Argentina_ summed up the British losses up to 25 May as: 5 warship\nsunk (correct number 3), 3 transport ships including SS _Canberra_ (1;\n_Atlantic Conveyor_), 14 Sea Harriers (2 shot down &amp; 3 accidents) and many\nships damaged, including HMS _Hermes_. _Gaceta Argentina_ even wrote: 'All of\nthese details refer only to proven claims and not to estimated or unproven\nclaims\u00a0...'.\"\n\n  131. **^** \"[_title\u00a0missing_]\". _La Naci\u00f3n_ (in Spanish).

Wikipedia's articles provide links designed to\nguide the user to related pages with additional information.\n\nWikipedia is written collaboratively by largely anonymous volunteers who write\nwithout pay. Anyone with Internet access can write and make changes to\nWikipedia articles, except in limited cases where editing is restricted to\nprevent disruption or vandalism. Users can contribute anonymously, under a\npseudonym, or, if they choose to, with their real identity.\n\nThe fundamental principles by which Wikipedia operates are the five pillars.\nThe Wikipedia community has developed many policies and guidelines to improve\nthe encyclopedia; however, it is not a formal requirement to be familiar with\nthem before contributing.\n\nSince its creation in 2001, Wikipedia has grown rapidly into one of the\nlargest reference websites, attracting 374 million unique visitors monthly as\nof September 2015[update].[1] There are about 70,000 active contributors\nworking on more than 38,000,000 articles in 290 languages. As of today, there\nare 5,109,365 articles in English. Every day, hundreds of thousands of\nvisitors from around the world collectively make tens of thousands of edits\nand create thousands of new articles to augment the knowledge held by the\nWikipedia encyclopedia. (See the statistics page for more information.)\n\nPeople of all ages, cultures and backgrounds can add or edit article prose,\nreferences, images and other media here. What is contributed is more important\nthan the expertise or qualifications of the contributor. What will remain\ndepends upon whether the content is free of copyright restrictions and\ncontentious material about living people, and whether it fits within\nWikipedia's policies, including being verifiable against a published reliable\nsource, thereby excluding editors' opinions and beliefs and unreviewed\nresearch. Contributions cannot damage Wikipedia because the software allows\neasy reversal of mistakes and many experienced editors are watching to help\nensure that edits are cumulative improvements. Begin by simply clicking the\n_Edit_ link at the top of any editable page!\n\nWikipedia is a live collaboration differing from paper-based reference sources\nin important ways. Unlike printed encyclopedias, Wikipedia is continually\ncreated and updated, with articles on historic events appearing within\nminutes, rather than months or years. Because everybody can help improve it,\nWikipedia has become more comprehensive than any other encyclopedia. In\naddition to quantity, its contributors work on improving quality as well.\nWikipedia is a work-in-progress, with articles in various stages of\ncompletion. As articles develop, they tend to become more comprehensive and\nbalanced. Quality also improves over time as misinformation and other errors\nare removed or repaired. However, because anyone can click \"edit\" at any time\nand add stuff in, any article may contain undetected misinformation, errors,\nor vandalism. Awareness of this helps the reader to obtain valid information,\navoid recently added misinformation (see _Wikipedia:Researching with\nWikipedia_), and fix the article.\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 About Wikipedia\n    * 1.1 Wikipedia history\n    * 1.2 Wikipedia contributors\n    * 1.3 Trademarks and copyrights\n    * 1.4 Credits\n  * 2 Making the best use of Wikipedia\n    * 2.1 Exploring Wikipedia\n    * 2.2 Basic navigation in Wikipedia\n    * 2.3 Using Wikipedia as a research tool\n    * 2.4 Wikipedia vs paper encyclopedias\n    * 2.5 Strengths, weaknesses, and article quality in Wikipedia\n    * 2.6 Disclaimers\n  * 3 Contributing to Wikipedia\n    * 3.1 Editing Wikipedia pages\n    * 3.2 Wikipedia content criteria\n    * 3.3 Editorial administration, oversight, and management\n    * 3.4 Handling disputes and abuse\n    * 3.5 Editorial quality review\n  * 4 Technical attributes\n  * 5 Feedback and questions\n    * 5.1 Frequently asked questions (FAQ)\n    * 5.2 Static help\n    * 5.3 Giving feedback\n    * 5.4 Research help and similar questions\n    * 5.5 Community discussion\n    * 5.6 Contacting individual Wikipedia editors\n  * 6 Other languages\n  * 7 Sister projects\n  * 8 See also\n  * 9 References\n  * 10 Further reading\n  * 11 External links\n\n## About Wikipedia\n\n### Wikipedia history\n\nFor more details on this topic, see History of Wikipedia.\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/EnwikipediaArt.PNG\n/250px-EnwikipediaArt.PNG)\n\nThe English edition of Wikipedia has grown to 5,109,365 articles, equivalent\nto over 2,000 print volumes of the _Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica_. Including all\nlanguage editions, Wikipedia has over 38\u00a0million articles, equivalent to over\n15,000 print volumes.\n\nWikipedia was founded as an offshoot of Nupedia, a now-abandoned project to\nproduce a free encyclopedia, begun by the online media company Bomis. Nupedia\nhad an elaborate system of peer review and required highly qualified\ncontributors, but the writing of articles was slow. During 2000, Jimmy Wales\n(founder of Nupedia and co-founder of Bomis), and Larry Sanger, whom Wales had\nemployed to work on the encyclopedia project, discussed ways of supplementing\nNupedia with a more open, complementary project. Multiple sources suggested\nthat a wiki might allow members of the public to contribute material, and\nNupedia's first wiki went online on January\u00a010, 2001.\n\nThere was considerable resistance on the part of Nupedia's editors and\nreviewers to the idea of associating Nupedia with a website in the wiki\nformat, so the new project was given the name \"Wikipedia\" and launched on its\nown domain, wikipedia.com, on January\u00a015 (now called \"Wikipedia Day\" by some\nusers). The bandwidth and server (in San Diego) were donated by Wales. Other\ncurrent and past Bomis employees who have worked on the project include Tim\nShell, one of the cofounders of Bomis and its current CEO, and programmer\nJason Richey.\n\nIn May 2001, a large number of non-English Wikipedias were launched\u2014in\nCatalan, Chinese, Dutch, Esperanto, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese,\nPortuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish. These were soon joined by Arabic\nand Hungarian. In September,[2] Polish was added, and further commitment to\nthe multilingual provision of Wikipedia was made. At the end of the year,\nAfrikaans, Norwegian, and Serbo-Croatian versions were announced.\n\nThe domain was eventually changed to the present wikipedia.org when the not-\nfor-profit Wikimedia Foundation was launched, in 2003, as its new parent\norganization, with the \".org\" top-level domain denoting its non-commercial\nnature. Today, there are Wikipedias in over 250 languages.\n\n### Wikipedia contributors\n\nMain pages: Wikipedia:Who writes Wikipedia? and Wikipedia:Wikipedians\n\n![File:The Impact Of Wikipedia.webm](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/\nthumb/6/69/The_Impact_Of_Wikipedia.webm/250px--\nThe_Impact_Of_Wikipedia.webm.jpg)Play media\n\nWikipedia contributors\n\nAnyone with Web access can edit Wikipedia, and this openness encourages\ninclusion of a tremendous amount of content. About 70,000\u00a0editors\u2014from expert\nscholars to casual readers\u2014regularly edit Wikipedia, and these experienced\neditors often help to create a consistent style throughout the encyclopedia,\nfollowing our Manual of Style.\n\nSeveral mechanisms are in place to help Wikipedia members carry out the\nimportant work of crafting a high-quality resource while maintaining civility.\nEditors are able to watch pages and technically skilled persons can write\nediting programs to keep track of or rectify bad edits. Where there are\ndisagreements on how to display facts, editors often work together to compile\nan article that fairly represents current expert opinion on the subject.\n\nAlthough the Wikimedia Foundation owns the site, it is largely uninvolved in\nwriting and daily operations.\n\n### Trademarks and copyrights\n\nMain pages: Wikipedia:Copyrights and wmf:Trademark policy\n\n\"Wikipedia\" is a registered trademark of the not-for-profit Wikimedia\nFoundation, which has created a family of free-content projects that are built\nby user contributions.\n\nMost of Wikipedia's text and many of its images are dual-licensed under the\nCreative Commons Attribution-Sharealike\u00a03.0 Unported License (CC-BY-SA) and\nthe GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL) (unversioned, with no invariant\nsections, front-cover texts, or back-cover texts).

At this very instant, dozens of articles are being improved,\nand new articles are also being created. Changes can be viewed at the Recent\nchanges page and a random page at random articles. Over 4,500\u00a0articles have\nbeen designated by the Wikipedia community as featured articles, exemplifying\nthe best articles in the encyclopedia. Another 22,000\u00a0articles are designated\nas good articles. Some information on Wikipedia is organized into lists; the\nbest of these are designated as featured lists. Wikipedia also has portals,\nwhich organize content around topic areas; our best portals are selected as\nfeatured portals. Articles can be found using the search box on the top-right\nside of the screen.\n\nWikipedia is available in languages other than English. Wikipedia has more\nthan two hundred and eighty languages, including a Simple English version, and\nrelated projects include a dictionary, quotations, books, manuals, and\nscientific reference sources, and a news service (see sister projects). All of\nthese are maintained, updated, and managed by separate communities, and often\ninclude information and articles that can be hard to find through other common\nsources.\n\n### Basic navigation in Wikipedia\n\nMain page: Help:Navigation\n\nWikipedia articles are all linked, or cross-referenced. When highlighted text\nlike this is seen, it means there is a link to some relevant article or\nWikipedia page with further in-depth information. Holding the mouse over the\nlink will often show to where the link will lead. There are other links\ntowards the ends of most articles, for other articles of interest, relevant\nexternal websites and pages, reference material, and organized categories of\nknowledge which can be searched and traversed in a loose hierarchy for more\ninformation. Some articles may also have links to dictionary definitions,\naudio-book readings, quotations, the same article in other languages, and\nfurther information available on our sister projects. Additional links can be\neasily made if a relevant link is missing\u2014this is one simple way to\ncontribute.\n\n### Using Wikipedia as a research tool\n\nMain pages: Wikipedia:Researching with Wikipedia and Wikipedia:Citing\nWikipedia\n\nAs wiki documents, articles are never considered complete and may be\ncontinually edited and improved. Over time, this generally results in an\nupward trend of quality and a growing consensus over a neutral representation\nof information.\n\nUsers should be aware that not all articles are of encyclopedic quality from\nthe start: they may contain false or debatable information. Indeed, many\narticles start their lives as displaying a single viewpoint; and, after a long\nprocess of discussion, debate, and argument, they gradually take on a neutral\npoint of view reached through consensus. Others may, for a while, become\ncaught up in a heavily unbalanced viewpoint which can take some time\u2014months or\nyears perhaps\u2014to achieve better balanced coverage of their subject. In part,\nthis is because editors often contribute content in which they have a\nparticular interest and do not attempt to make each article that they edit\ncomprehensive. However, eventually, additional editors expand and contribute\nto articles and strive to achieve balance and comprehensive coverage. In\naddition, Wikipedia operates a number of internal resolution processes that\ncan assist when editors disagree on content and approach. Usually, editors\neventually reach a consensus on ways to improve the article.\n\nThe _ideal_ Wikipedia article is well written, balanced, neutral, and\nencyclopedic, containing comprehensive, notable, verifiable knowledge. An\nincreasing number of articles reach this standard over time, and many already\nhave. Our best articles are called Featured Articles (and display a small star\nin the upper right corner of the article), and our second best tier of\narticles are designated Good Articles. However, this is a process and can take\nmonths or years to be achieved through the concerted effort of editors. Some\narticles contain statements which have not yet been fully cited. Others will\nlater be augmented with new sections. Some information will be considered by\nlater contributors to be insufficiently founded and, therefore, may be\nremoved.\n\nWhile the overall trend is toward improvement, it is important to use\nWikipedia carefully if it is intended to be used as a research source, since\nindividual articles will, by their nature, vary in quality and maturity.\nGuidelines and information pages are available to help users and researchers\ndo this effectively, as is an article that summarizes third-party studies and\nassessments of the reliability of Wikipedia.\n\n### Wikipedia vs paper encyclopedias\n\n  * _Main article: Wiki is not paper, on Wikimedia Meta-Wiki_.\n\nWikipedia has advantages over traditional paper encyclopedias. First, is that\nit is not limited in space: it can keep growing as fast as people add to it.\nSecond, there are no qualifications required to be able to author its\narticles. Therefore, it has a very large pool of contributors: the whole\nworld. These two aspects have enabled Wikipedia to become the most\ncomprehensive encyclopedia on Earth.\n\nThird, a paper encyclopedia remains static (stays the same) and falls out of\ndate until the next edition. But Wikipedia is dynamic: you don't have to wait\nfor the next edition to come out (there are no editions), as Wikipedia is\npublished on-line as it is written (also on-line). Articles are made available\nas is, regardless of what stage of development they are in. _You_ can update\nWikipedia at any instant, and people do so continually around the clock,\nthereby helping each other to keep abreast of the most recent events\neverywhere and of the latest facts in every subject.\n\nFourth, Wikipedia has a very low \"publishing\" cost for adding or expanding\nentries, as it is on-line, with no need to buy paper or ink for distribution.\nThis has allowed it to be made available for free, making it more accessible\nto everyone. This has enabled Wikipedia to be independently developed and\npublished in many different languages at the same time, by people literate in\neach language. Of the 280+ different language Wikipedias, 132 of them have\n10,000 or more articles.\n\nFifth, Wikipedia has a low environmental impact in some respects, since it\nnever needs to be printed, although computers have their own environmental\ncost.\n\nSixth, Wikipedia is extra-linear (more than linear). Instead of in-line\nexplanations, Wikipedia incorporates hypertext in the form of wikilinks.\nThroughout its content is a robust network of links, providing another\ndimension of knowledge accessibility. The encyclopedia also has correlates to\ntables of contents and indexes, with each entry in them hyperlinked to an\narticle on the topic specified.\n\nSeventh, each Wikipedia article provides an introduction summarizing the more\nextensive detail of its contents.\n\nEighth, being open to anyone to edit, articles on Wikipedia are subject to\nadditions that are erroneous, written poorly, or which are sheer vandalism. It\nis a community effort, with most people who are involved helping to improve\nthe work, fixing problems they encounter along the way. See more about\nWikipedia's strengths and weaknesses, below...\n\n### Strengths, weaknesses, and article quality in Wikipedia\n\nMain pages: Wikipedia:Why Wikipedia is so great and Wikipedia:Why Wikipedia is\nnot so great\n\nSee also: Reliability of Wikipedia and Wikipedia:Researching with Wikipedia\n\nWikipedia's greatest strengths, weaknesses, and differences all arise because\nit is open to anyone, it has a large contributor base, and its articles are\nwritten by consensus, according to editorial guidelines and policies.\n\n  * Wikipedia is **open to a large contributor base**, drawing a large number of editors from diverse backgrounds. This allows Wikipedia to significantly reduce regional and cultural bias found in many other publications, and makes it very difficult for any group to censor and impose bias. A large, diverse editor base also provides access and breadth on subject matter that is otherwise inaccessible or little documented. A large number of editors contributing at any moment also means that Wikipedia can produce encyclopedic articles and resources covering newsworthy events within hours or days of their occurrence. It also means that like any publication, Wikipedia may reflect the cultural, age, socio-economic, and other biases of its contributors. There is no systematic process to make sure that \"obviously important\" topics are written about, so Wikipedia may contain unexpected oversights and omissions. While _most_ articles may be altered by anyone, in practice editing will be performed by a certain demographic (younger rather than older, male rather than female, rich enough to afford a computer rather than poor, et cetera) and may, therefore, show some bias. Some topics may not be covered well, while others may be covered in great depth.\n  * Allowing **anyone to edit** Wikipedia means that it is more easily vandalized or susceptible to unchecked information, which requires removal. See Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism. While blatant vandalism is usually easily spotted and rapidly corrected, Wikipedia is more subject to subtle viewpoint promotion than a typical reference work. However, bias that would be unchallenged in a traditional reference work is likely to be ultimately challenged or considered on Wikipedia. While Wikipedia articles generally attain a good standard after editing, it is important to note that fledgling articles and those monitored less well may be susceptible to vandalism and insertion of false information. Wikipedia's radical openness also means that any given article may be, at any given moment, in a bad state, such as in the middle of a large edit, or a controversial rewrite. Many contributors do not yet comply fully with key policies, or may add information without citable sources. Wikipedia's open approach tremendously increases the chances that any particular factual error or misleading statement will be relatively promptly corrected. Numerous editors at any given time are monitoring recent changes and edits to articles on their watchlists.\n  * Wikipedia is **written by open and transparent consensus**\u2014an approach that has its pros and cons. Censorship or imposing \"official\" points of view is extremely difficult to achieve and usually fails after a time. Eventually for most articles, all notable views become fairly described and a neutral point of view reached. In reality, the process of reaching consensus may be long and drawn-out, with articles fluid or changeable for a long time while they find their \"neutral approach\" that all sides can agree on. Reaching neutrality is occasionally made harder by extreme-viewpoint contributors. Wikipedia operates a full editorial dispute resolution process, one that allows time for discussion and resolution in depth, but one that also permits disagreements to last for months before poor-quality or biased edits are removed. A common conclusion is that Wikipedia is a valuable resource and provides a good reference point on its subjects.\n  * That said, articles and subject areas sometimes suffer from significant omissions, and while misinformation and vandalism are usually corrected quickly, this does not always happen. (See for example this incident in which a person inserted a fake biography linking a prominent journalist to the Kennedy assassinations and Soviet Russia as a joke on a co-worker which went undetected for four months, saying afterwards he \"didn\u2019t know Wikipedia was used as a serious reference tool\".)\n  * Wikipedia is **written largely by amateurs**. Those with expert credentials are given no additional weight. Wikipedia is also not subject to any peer review for scientific, medical or engineering articles. One advantage to having amateurs write in Wikipedia is that they have more free time on their hands so that they can make rapid changes in response to current events. The wider the general public interest in a topic, the more likely it is to attract contributions from non-specialists.\n\nThe MediaWiki software that runs Wikipedia retains a history of all edits and\nchanges, thus information added to Wikipedia never \"vanishes\" irreversibly.\nDiscussion pages are an important resource on contentious topics. Therefore,\nserious researchers can often find a wide range of vigorously or thoughtfully\nadvocated viewpoints not present in the consensus article. As with any source,\ninformation should be checked. A 2005 editorial by a BBC technology writer\ncomments that these debates are probably symptomatic of cultural changes that\nare happening across all sources of information (including search engines and\nthe media), and may lead to \"a better sense of how to evaluate information\nsources\".[3]\n\n### Disclaimers\n\nDisclaimers  \n---  \n  \n  * General\n  * Content\n  * Legal\n  * Medical\n  * Risk  \nRelated  \n  \n  * Academic use\n  * Non-Wikipedia  \n  \n  * v\n  * t\n  * e  \n  \nMain page: Wikipedia:Disclaimers\n\nWikipedia disclaimers apply to all pages on Wikipedia. However, the consensus\nin Wikipedia is to put all disclaimers only as links and at the end of each\narticle. Proposals to have a warning box at the beginning have been rejected.\nSome do not like the way it looks or that it calls attention to possible\nerrors in Wikipedia.\n\nWikipedia, in common with many websites, has a disclaimer that, at times, has\nled to commentators citing these in order to support a view that Wikipedia is\nunreliable. A selection of similar disclaimers from places which are often\nregarded as reliable (including sources such as Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica,\nAssociated Press, and the Oxford English Dictionary) can be read and compared\nat Wikipedia:Non-Wikipedia disclaimers.

Once the contributor has decided a topic of interest, they\nmay want to request that the article be written (or they could research the\nissue and write it themselves). Wikipedia has on-going projects, focused on\nspecific topic areas or tasks, which help coordinate editing.\n\nThe ease of editing Wikipedia results in many people editing.

(3:07 min)\n\nWikipedia uses a simple yet powerful page layout to allow editors to\nconcentrate on adding material rather than page design. Page aspects\nfacilitated include:\n\n  * sections and subsections\u2014which follow a page's lead section/introduction and (if specific conditions are met) a table of contents,\n  * references,\n  * images,\n  * tables,\n  * indentations\n  * lists,\n  * links,\n  * ISBNs,\n  * maths,\n  * formatting elements and most world alphabets and common symbols, Most of which have simple formats that are deliberately very easy and intuitive.\n\nNormally editing is chosen by clicking the `Edit` tab at the top of a\nWikipedia page (or on a section-edit link). This will take you to a new page\nwith a text box containing the editable text of the page you were viewing. In\nthis box, you can type in the text that you want to add, using wiki markup to\nformat the text and add other elements like images and tables. You should then\npress the `Show preview` button to review your contributions for any errors.\nWhen you have finished editing, you should write a short edit summary in the\nsmall field below the edit-box describing your changes before you press the\n`Save page` button. This will help others to understand the intention of your\nedit. To avoid accidentally leaving edit summaries blank, you can select\n\"Prompt me when entering a blank edit summary\" on the `Editing` tab of your\npersonal preferences.\n\nPage editing is accessed through tabs that are found along the top edge of the\npage. These are:\n\n  * _Article._ Shows the main Wikipedia article.\n  * _Talk._ Shows a user discussion about the article's topic and possible revisions, controversies, etc.\n  * _Edit._ This tab allows users to edit the article. Depending on the page\u2019s susceptibility to vandalism, according to its visibility or the degree of controversy surrounding the topic, this tab may not be shown for all users. (For example, any user who is not an administrator will not be able to edit the Main Page.)\n  * _View history._ This tab allows readers to view the editors of the article and the changes that have been made.\n  * _Star._ (\"Watch\") If you are logged into your account, clicking on the star icon will cause any changes made to the article to be displayed on the watchlist. (Note: when this icon is clicked, it changes to a filled-in star.)\n\nWikipedia has robust version and reversion controls. This means that poor-\nquality edits or vandalism can quickly and easily be reversed or brought up to\nan appropriate standard by any other editor, so inexperienced editors cannot\naccidentally do permanent harm if they make a mistake in their editing. As\nthere are many more editors intent on improving articles than not, error-\nridden articles are usually corrected promptly.\n\n### Wikipedia content criteria\n\nMain pages: Wikipedia:Wikipedia in brief and Wikipedia:Core content policies\n\nCore content policies  \n---  \n  \n  * Neutral point of view\n  * No original research\n  * Verifiability  \nOther content policies  \n  \n  * Article titles\n  * Biographies of living persons\n  * Image use policy\n  * What Wikipedia is not  \n  \n  * v\n  * t\n  * e  \n  \nWikipedia content is intended to be factual, notable, verifiable with cited\nexternal sources, and neutrally presented.\n\nThe appropriate policies and guidelines for these are found at:\n\n  1. Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not, which summarizes what belongs in Wikipedia and what does not;\n  2. Wikipedia:Neutral point of view, which describes Wikipedia's mandatory core approach to neutral, unbiased article-writing;\n  3. Wikipedia:No original research, which prohibits the use of Wikipedia to publish personal views and original research of editors and defines Wikipedia's role as an encyclopedia of existing _recognized_ knowledge;\n  4. Wikipedia:Verifiability, which explains that it must be possible for readers to verify all content against credible external sources (following the guidance in the Wikipedia:Risk disclaimer that is linked-to at the end of every article);\n  5. Wikipedia:Reliable sources, which explains what factors determine whether a source is acceptable;\n  6. Wikipedia:Citing sources, which describes the manner of citing sources so that readers can verify content for themselves;\n  7. And Wikipedia:Manual of Style, which offers a style guide\u2014in general editors tend to acquire knowledge of appropriate writing styles and detailed formatting over time.\n\nThese are often abbreviated to WP:NOT, WP:NPOV, WP:NOR, WP:V, WP:RS, WP:CITE,\nand WP:MOS respectively.\n\n### Editorial administration, oversight, and management\n\nMain page: Wikipedia:Editorial oversight and control\n\n![File:Wikipedia video tutorial-2-Reliability-en.ogv](//upload.wikimedia.org/w\nikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Wikipedia_video_tutorial-2-Reliability-\nen.ogv/220px--Wikipedia_video_tutorial-2-Reliability-en.ogv.jpg)Play media\n\nVideo guided tour #2: Why does Wikipedia work even though anyone can edit it?\n\nThe Wikipedia community is largely self-organising, so that anyone may build a\nreputation as a competent editor and become involved in any role s/he may\nchoose, subject to peer approval. Individuals often will choose to become\ninvolved in specialised tasks, such as reviewing articles at others' request,\nwatching current edits for vandalism, watching newly created articles for\nquality control purposes, or similar roles. Editors who believe they can serve\nthe community better by taking on additional administrative responsibility may\nask their peers for agreement to undertake such responsibilities. This\nstructure enforces meritocracy and communal standards of editorship and\nconduct. At present a minimum approval of 75\u201380% from the community is\nrequired to take on these additional tools and responsibilities. This standard\ntends to ensure a high level of experience, trust, and familiarity across a\nbroad front of aspects within Wikipedia.\n\nA variety of software-assisted systems and automated programs help editors and\nadministrators to watch for problematic edits and editors. Theoretically all\neditors and users are treated equally with no \"power structure\". There is,\nhowever, a hierarchy of permissions and positions, some of which are listed\nhereafter:\n\n  1. _Anyone_ can edit most of the articles here. Some articles are protected because of vandalism or edit-warring, and can only be edited by certain editors.\n  2. Anyone with an account that has been registered for four days or longer and has made at least ten edits becomes _autoconfirmed_, and gains the technical ability to do three things that non-autoconfirmed editors cannot: \n    * Move articles.\n    * Edit semi-protected articles.\n    * Vote in certain elections (minimum edit count to receive suffrage varies depending on the election).\n  3. Many editors with accounts obtain access to certain tools that make editing easier and faster. Few editors learn about most of those tools, but one common privilege granted to editors in good standing is \"rollback\", which is the ability to undo edits more easily.\n  4. Administrators (\"admins\" or \"sysops\") have been approved by the community, and have access to some significant administrative tools. They can delete articles, block accounts or IP addresses, and edit fully protected articles.\n  5. Bureaucrats are chosen in a process similar to that for selecting administrators. There are not very many bureaucrats. They have the technical ability to add or remove admin rights, approve or revoke \"bot\" privileges, and rename user accounts.\n  6. The Arbitration Committee is analogous to Wikipedia's supreme court. They deal with disputes that remain unresolved after other attempts at dispute resolution have failed. Members of this Committee are elected by the community and tend to be selected from among the pool of experienced admins.\n  7. Stewards are the top echelon of technical permissions. Stewards can do a few technical things, and one almost never hears much about them since they normally only act when a local admin or bureaucrat is not available, and hence almost never on the English Wikipedia. There are very few stewards.\n  8. Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, has several special roles and privileges. In most instances, however, he does not expect to be treated differently than any other editor or administrator.\n\n### Handling disputes and abuse\n\nMain pages: Wikipedia:Vandalism, Wikipedia:Dispute resolution,\nWikipedia:Consensus, Wikipedia:Sock puppetry and Wikipedia:Conflict of\ninterest\n\nWikipedia has a rich set of methods to handle most abuses that commonly arise.\nThese methods are well-tested and should be relied upon.\n\n  * Intentional _vandalism_ can be reported and corrected by anyone.\n  * Unresolved _disputes_ between editors, whether based upon behavior, editorial approach, or validity of content, can be addressed through the talk page of an article, through requesting comments from other editors or through Wikipedia's comprehensive dispute resolution process.\n  * _Abuse of user accounts_, such as the creation of \"Internet sock puppets\" or solicitation of friends and other parties to enforce a non-neutral viewpoint or inappropriate consensus within a discussion, or to disrupt other Wikipedia processes in an annoying manner, are addressed through the sock puppet policy.\n\nIn addition, new users may initially find that their votes are given less\nweight by editors in some informal polls in order to prevent abuse of single-\npurpose accounts.\n\n### Editorial quality review\n\nAs well as systems to catch and control substandard and vandalistic edits,\nWikipedia also has a full style and content manual and a variety of positive\nsystems for continual article review and improvement. Examples of the\nprocesses include peer review, good article assessment, and the featured\narticle process, a rigorous review of articles that are intended to meet the\nhighest standards and showcase Wikipedia's capability to produce high-quality\nwork.\n\nIn addition, specific types of article or fields often have their own\nspecialized and comprehensive projects, assessment processes (such as\nbiographical article assessment), and expert reviewers within specific\nsubjects. Nominated articles are also frequently the subject of specific focus\non the neutral point of view noticeboard or in WikiProject Cleanup.\n\n## Technical attributes\n\nWikipedia uses MediaWiki software, the open-source program used not only on\nWikimedia projects but also on many other third-party websites. The hardware\nsupporting the Wikimedia projects is based on several hundred servers in\nvarious hosting centers around the world. Full descriptions of these servers\nand their roles are available on this Meta-Wiki page. For technical\ninformation about Wikipedia, check Technical FAQ. Wikipedia publishes various\ntypes of metadata; and, across its pages, are many thousands of microformats.\n\n## Feedback and questions\n\nWikipedia is run as a communal effort. It is a community project whose result\nis an encyclopedia. Feedback about content should, in the first instance, be\nraised on the discussion pages of those articles. Be bold and edit the pages\nto add information or correct mistakes.\n\n### Frequently asked questions (FAQ)\n\nMain page: Wikipedia:FAQ\n\n  * FAQ Index\n  * Category:Wikipedia FAQ\n\n### Static help\n\nThe Help:Contents may be accessed by clicking _help_ displayed under the _\u25ba\nInteraction_\u00a0tab at the top left of all pages.\n\n  * Help:Menu\u2014is a menu-style page that will direct you to the right place to find information.\n  * Help:Contents/Directory\u2014is a descriptive listing of all Wikipedia's informative, instructional and consultation pages.\n\n### Giving feedback\n\nThere is an established escalation-and-dispute process within Wikipedia, as\nwell as pages designed for questions, feedback, suggestions, and comments. For\na full listing of the services and assistance that can be requested on\nWikipedia, see Wikipedia:Requests.\n\n  * Talk pages\u2014the associated discussion page for discussion of an article or policy's contents (usually the first place to go)\n  * Wikipedia:Vandalism\u2014a facility for reporting vandalism (but fix vandalism as well as report it)\n  * Dispute resolution\u2014the procedure for handling disputes that remain unresolved within an article's talk space\n  * Village pump\u2014the Wikipedia discussion area, part of the community portal\n  * Wikipedia:Contact us\n\nSee also:\n\n  * Bug tracker\u2014a facility for reporting problems with the Wikipedia website or the MediaWiki software that runs it\n  * Village pump: proposals page\u2014a place for making non-policy suggestions\n  * And Wikipedia:Help desk\u2014Wikipedia's general help desk, if other pages have not answered the query\n\n### Research help and similar questions\n\nFacilities to help users researching specific topics can be found at:\n\n  * Wikipedia:Requested articles\u2014to suggest or request articles for the future.\n  * Wikipedia:Reference desk\u2014to ask for help with any questions, or in finding specific facts.\n  * Wikipedia:Researching with Wikipedia\u2014for information on using Wikipedia as a research tool.\n\nBecause of the nature of Wikipedia, it is encouraged that people looking for\ninformation should try to find it themselves in the first instance. If,\nhowever, information is found to be missing from Wikipedia, be bold and add it\nso others can gain.\n\n### Community discussion\n\nFor specific discussion not related to article content or editor conduct, see\nthe Village pump, which covers such subjects as announcements, policy and\ntechnical discussion, and information on other specialized portals such as the\nhelp, reference and peer review desks. The Community Portal is a centralized\nplace to find things to do, collaborations, and general editing help\ninformation, and find out what is happening. _The Signpost_, a community-\nedited newspaper, has recent news regarding Wikipedia, its sister projects,\nand the Wikimedia Foundation.\n\n### Contacting individual Wikipedia editors\n\nTo contact individual contributors, leave a message on their talk page.\nStandard places to ask policy and project-related questions are the Village\nPump, online, and the Wikipedia mailing-lists, over e-mail. Reach other\nWikipedians via IRC and e-mail.\n\nIn addition, the Wikimedia Foundation **Meta-Wiki** is a site for coordinating\nthe various Wikipedia projects and sister projects (and abstract discussions\nof policy and direction). Also available are places for submitting bug reports\nand feature requests.\n\nFor a full list of contact options, see **Wikipedia:Contact us**.\n\n## Other languages\n\nThis Wikipedia is written in English.

The foundation is mostly known for hosting Wikipedia, the\nInternet encyclopedia, as well as Wiktionary, Wikiquote, Wikibooks,\nWikisource, Wikimedia Commons, Wikispecies, Wikinews, Wikiversity, Wikidata,\nWikivoyage, Wikimedia Incubator, and Meta-Wiki. It also owned the now-defunct\nNupedia.\n\nThe Wikimedia organization was founded in 2003 by Jimmy Wales, co-founder of\nWikipedia, as a way to fund Wikipedia and its sister projects through non-\nprofit means.[4][5]\n\nAs of 2015[update], the foundation employs over 280 people, with annual\nrevenues in excess of US$75 million.[2] Lila Tretikov presently leads the\nfoundation as its executive director, though on 26 February 2016 she announced\nher resignation effective 31 March, as a result of the WMF's controversial\nKnowledge Engine project.[6][7] Patricio Lorente is chairman of the board.[8]\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Goal\n  * 2 History\n  * 3 Projects and initiatives\n    * 3.1 Wikimedia projects\n    * 3.2 Movement affiliates\n    * 3.3 Wikimania\n    * 3.4 Strategic plan\n    * 3.5 Wikipedia Usability Initiative\n    * 3.6 Public Policy Initiative\n  * 4 Technology\n    * 4.1 Hardware\n    * 4.2 Softw\u0430r\u0435\n  * 5 Finances\n    * 5.1 In general\n    * 5.2 Grants\n    * 5.3 Financial summary\n  * 6 Governance\n    * 6.1 Board of Trustees\n    * 6.2 Advisory board\n  * 7 Staff\n    * 7.1 First appointments\n    * 7.2 Employees\n  * 8 Disputes and lawsuits\n  * 9 See also\n  * 10 References\n  * 11 External links\n    * 11.1 Other\n\n## Goal[edit]\n\nThe Wikimedia Foundation's stated goal is to develop and maintain open\ncontent, wiki-based projects and to provide the full contents of those\nprojects to the public free of charge.[9]\n\nThe Wikimedia Foundation was granted section 501(c)(3) status by the US\nInternal Revenue Code as a public charity in 2005.[10] Its National Taxonomy\nof Exempt Entities (NTEE) code is B60 (Adult, Continuing education).[11][12]\nThe foundation's by-laws declare a statement of purpose of collecting and\ndeveloping educational content and to disseminate it effectively and\nglobally.[13]\n\n## History[edit]\n\nIn 2001, Jimmy Wales, an Internet entrepreneur, and Larry Sanger, a\nphilosopher of knowledge and online community organizer, founded Wikipedia and\nNupedia as Internet encyclopedias. The project was originally funded by Bomis,\nWales' for-profit business. As Wikipedia's popularity skyrocketed, revenues to\nfund the project stalled.[4] Since Wikipedia was depleting Bomis' resources,\nWales and Sanger thought of a charity model to fund the project.[4] The\nWikimedia Foundation was incorporated in Florida on June 20, 2003.[5][14] It\napplied to the United States Patent and Trademark Office to trademark\n_Wikipedia_ on September 17, 2004. The mark was granted registration status on\nJanuary 10, 2006. Trademark protection was accorded by Japan on December 16,\n2004, and, in the European Union, on January 20, 2005. There were plans to\nlicense the use of the Wikipedia trademark for some products, such as books or\nDVDs.[15]\n\nIn April 2005, the US Internal Revenue Service approved the foundation as an\neducational foundation in the category \"Adult, Continuing education\", meaning\nall contributions to the foundation are tax-deductible for US federal income\ntax purposes.\n\nOn December 11, 2006, the Foundation's board noted that the corporation could\nnot become the membership organization initially planned but never implemented\ndue to an inability to meet the registration requirements of Florida statutory\nlaw. Accordingly, the by-laws were amended to remove all reference to\nmembership rights and activities. The decision to change the bylaws was passed\nby the board unanimously.[16]\n\nOn September 25, 2007, the foundation's board gave notice that the operations\nwould be moving to the San Francisco Bay Area. Major considerations cited for\nchoosing San Francisco were proximity to like-minded organizations and\npotential partners, a better talent pool, as well as cheaper and more\nconvenient international travel than is available from St. Petersburg,\nFlorida.[17][18][19]\n\n## Projects and initiatives[edit]\n\n###  Wikimedia projects[edit]\n\nMain article: Wikimedia projects\n\nIn addition to Wikipedia, the foundation operates other wikis that follow the\nfree content model with their main goal being the dissemination of knowledge.\nThese include:\n\n![Wikibooks logo](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa\n/Wikibooks-logo.svg/50px-Wikibooks-logo.svg.png) | **Name:** Wikibooks  \n**Description:** collection of textbooks  \n**Website:** www.wikibooks.org | ![Wikinews logo](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Wikinews-logo.svg/50px-Wikinews-logo.svg.png) | **Name:** Wikinews  \n**Description:** online newspaper  \n**Website:** www.wikinews.org | ![Wikispecies logo](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Wikispecies-logo.svg/50px-Wikispecies-logo.svg.png) | **Name:** Wikispecies  \n**Description:** taxonomic catalogue of species  \n**Website:** species.wikimedia.org  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n![Wikidata logo](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Wikidata-\nlogo.svg/50px-Wikidata-logo.svg.png) | **Name:** Wikidata  \n**Description:** knowledge base  \n**Website:** www.wikidata.org | ![Wikipedia logo](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/80/Wikipedia-logo-v2.svg/50px-Wikipedia-logo-v2.svg.png) | **Name:** Wikipedia  \n**Description:** online encyclopedia  \n**Website:** www.wikipedia.org | ![Wikiversity logo](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Wikiversity-logo.svg/50px-Wikiversity-logo.svg.png) | **Name:** Wikiversity  \n**Description:** collection of tutorials and courses, while also serving as a hosting point to coordinate research.  \n**Website:** www.wikiversity.org  \n![Wikimedia Commons logo](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a\n/Commons-logo.svg/50px-Commons-logo.svg.png) | **Name:** Wikimedia Commons  \n**Description:** repository of images, sounds, videos, and general media.  \n**Website:** commons.wikimedia.org | ![Wikiquote logo](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg/50px-Wikiquote-logo.svg.png) | **Name:** Wikiquote  \n**Description:** collection of quotations  \n**Website:** www.wikiquote.org | ![Wikivoyage logo](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Wikivoyage-logo.svg/50px-Wikivoyage-logo.svg.png) | **Name:** Wikivoyage  \n**Description:** travel guide  \n**Website:** www.wikivoyage.org  \n![Wikimedia Meta logo](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Wik\nimedia_Community_Logo.svg/50px-Wikimedia_Community_Logo.svg.png) | **Name:**\nMeta-Wiki  \n**Description:** central site to coordinate all Wikimedia projects.  \n**Website:** meta.wikimedia.org | ![Wikisource logo](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/50px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png) | **Name:** Wikisource  \n**Description:** digital library  \n**Website:** www.wikisource.org | ![Wiktionary logo](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Wiktionary-logo.svg/50px-Wiktionary-logo.svg.png) | **Name:** Wiktionary  \n**Description:** online dictionary and thesaurus  \n**Website:** www.wiktionary.org  \n  \n### Movement affiliates[edit]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Wikimedia_chapters_exi\nsting_and_regional_user_groups.svg/220px-\nWikimedia_chapters_existing_and_regional_user_groups.svg.png)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Wikimedia chapters (blue)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Wikimedia user groups with a geographic focus (green)\n\nSee also: List of Wikimedia chapters\n\nWikimedia movement affiliates are independent, but formally recognized, groups\nof people intended to work together to support and contribute to the Wikimedia\nmovement. The Wikimedia Foundation's Board of Trustees has approved three\nactive models for movement affiliates: chapters, thematic organizations, and\nuser groups. Movement affiliates are intended to organize and engage in\nactivities to support and contribute to the Wikimedia movement, such as\nregional conferences, outreach, edit-a-thons, hackathons, public relations,\npublic policy advocacy, GLAM engagement, and Wikimania.[20][21][22]\n\nRecognition of a chapter and thematic organization is approved by the\nfoundation's board. Recommendations on recognition of chapters and thematic\norganizations are made to the foundation's board by an Affiliations Committee,\ncomposed of Wikimedia community volunteers. The Affiliations Committee\napproves the recognition of individual user groups. While movement affiliates\nare formally recognized by the Wikimedia Foundation, they are independent of\nthe Wikimedia Foundation, with no legal control of nor responsibility for the\nWikimedia projects.[21][22][23]\n\nThe foundation began recognizing chapters in 2004.[24] In 2010, development on\nadditional models began. In 2012, the foundation approved, finalized, and\nadopted the thematic organization and user group recognition models. An\nadditional model, movement partners, was also approved but as of 27 October\n2015[update] has not yet been finalized or adopted.[20][22][25]\n\nWikimedia chapters are national (or in some cases sub-national) not-for-profit\norganisations created to support and promote the Wikimedia projects\nlocally.[21][22][24][26][27][28] Following recognition by the Wikimedia\nFoundation Board of Trustees, they enter into a \"Chapters Agreement\" with the\nfoundation.[21] As of 27 October 2015[update], there are 41 recognized\nWikimedia chapters.[20][24]\n\nWikimedia thematic organizations are not-for-profit organisations created to\nsupport and promote the Wikimedia projects and focused on a specific theme,\ntopic, subject or issue within or across countries and regions.[22][29]\nFollowing recognition by the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees, they\nenter into a \"Thematic Organizations Agreement\" with the foundation.[21] As of\n27 October 2015[update], there is one recognized Wikimedia thematic\norganization.[20][29]\n\nWikimedia user groups are less formal groups created to support and promote\nthe Wikimedia projects locally or on a specific theme, topic, subject, or\nissue. The user group model was created as a more simple and flexible\nalternative to chapters and thematic organizations - which have more formal\nrequirements.[22][30] Once they are recognized by the Affiliations Committee,\nthey enter into a \"User Groups Agreement and Code of Conduct\" with the\nfoundation.[21] As of 27 October 2015[update], there are 47 recognized\nWikimedia user groups.[20][30]\n\n### Wikimania[edit]\n\nMain article: Wikimania\n\nEach year, an international conference called Wikimania brings the people\ntogether who are involved in the Wikimedia organizations and projects. The\nfirst Wikimania was held in Frankfurt, Germany, in 2005. Nowadays, Wikimania\nis organized by a committee supported usually by the national chapter, in\ncollaboration with the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikimania has been held in cities\nsuch as Buenos Aires,[31] Cambridge,[32] Haifa,[33] Hong Kong,[34] and\nLondon.[35] In 2015, Wikimania took place in Mexico City.[36] In 2016,\nWikimania will be held in Esino Lario, Italy.[37]\n\n### Strategic plan[edit]\n\n![File:Wikimedia Strategic Plan.ogv](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/\nthumb/b/b7/Wikimedia_Strategic_Plan.ogv/220px-\nseek%3D248-Wikimedia_Strategic_Plan.ogv.jpg)Play media\n\nVideo explaining the Wikimedia Strategic Plan\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Lila_Tretikov_April_20\n14_%285%29_crop.jpg/220px-Lila_Tretikov_April_2014_%285%29_crop.jpg)\n\nExecutive director Lila Tretikov, 2014\n\nIn response to the growing size and popularity of Wikipedia, the Wikimedia\nFoundation announced a Strategic Plan to improve and sustain the Wikimedia\nmovement. The plan was announced in July 2009, followed by a process of\ninterviews and surveys with people from across the Wikimedia movement,\nincluding board of trustees, members of staff and volunteer editors.[38] The\nongoing plan was intended to be the basis of a five-year plan to further\noutreach, improve content quality and quality control, and optimising\noperational areas such as finance and infrastructure.[39]\n\n### Wikipedia Usability Initiative[edit]\n\nIn December 2008, the Wikimedia Foundation announced a restricted donation\ngrant of US$890,000 from the Stanton Foundation, to improve Wikipedia's\naccessibility.[40] Later named the Wikipedia Usability Initiative, the grant\nwas used by the Wikimedia Foundation to appoint project-specific staff to the\ntechnology department.[41]\n\nA series of surveys were conducted throughout 2009. This began with a\nqualitative environment survey on MediaWiki extensions, followed by a\nQualitative Statistical Survey focusing on volume of edits, number of new\nusers, and related statistics. In March 2009, a usability and experience study\nwas carried out on new and non-editors of the English Wikipedia. The aim was\nto discover what obstacles participants encountered while editing Wikipedia,\nranging from small changes to more complicated syntax such as templates. The\nstudy recruited 2500 people for in-person laboratory testing via the Wikipedia\nwebsite, which was filtered down to ten participants. The results were\ncollated and used by the technology team to improve Wikipedia's usability.[42]\nThe Usability and Experience Study was followed up by the Usability,\nExperience and Progress Study in September 2009. This study recruited\ndifferent new and non-editors for in-person trials on a new Wikipedia\nskin.[43]\n\nThe initiative ultimately culminated in a new Wikipedia skin named Vector,\nconstructed based on the results of the usability studies. This was introduced\nby default in stages, beginning in May 2010.[44]\n\n### Public Policy Initiative[edit]\n\nIn May 2010, the Wikimedia Foundation announced the Public Policy Initiative,\nfollowing a US$1.2 million donation by the Stanton Foundation. The Initiative\nwas set up to improve articles relating to public policy\u2013related issues.[45]\nAs part of the initiative, Wikipedia collaborated with ten universities to\nhelp students and professors create and maintain articles relating to public\npolicy.[46] Volunteer editors of Wikipedia, known as \"ambassadors\", provided\nassistance to students and professors. This was either done on campus sites or\nonline.[47]\n\n## Technology[edit]\n\nThe foundation employs technology including hardware and software to run its\nprojects.\n\n### Hardware[edit]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Wikipedia_webrequest_f\nlow_2015-10.png/220px-Wikipedia_webrequest_flow_2015-10.png)\n\nOverview of system architecture, October 2015.

Originally,\nWikipedia ran on UseModWiki written in Perl by Clifford Adams (Phase I), which\ninitially required CamelCase for article hyperlinks; the present double\nbracket style was incorporated later. Starting in January 2002 (Phase II),\nWikipedia began running on a PHP wiki engine with a MySQL database; this\nsoftware was custom-made for Wikipedia by Magnus Manske. The Phase II software\nwas repeatedly modified to accommodate the exponentially increasing demand. In\nJuly 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia shifted to the third-generation software,\nMediaWiki, originally written by Lee Daniel Crocker. Several MediaWiki\nextensions are installed to extend the functionality of MediaWiki software. In\nApril 2005, a Lucene extension[55][56] was added to MediaWiki's built-in\nsearch and Wikipedia switched from MySQL to Lucene for searching. Currently\nLucene Search 2.1,[57] which is written in Java and based on Lucene library\n2.3,[58] is used.

Sloan Foundation authorized another US$3 million\ngrant to continue to develop and maintain the Foundation's mission. The grant\nwas to be funded over three years with the first US$1 million funded in July\n2011 and the remaining US$2 million was scheduled to be funded in August 2012\nand 2013. In August 2011, the Stanton Foundation pledged to fund a US$3.6\nmillion grant of which US$1.8 million was funded and the remaining was due to\nbe funded in September 2012. As of 2011, this was the largest grant received\nby the Wikimedia Foundation to-date.[81] In November 2011, the Foundation\nreceived a US$500,000 donation from Google co-founder Sergey Brin and his\nwife.[82][83]\n\nIn 2012, the Foundation was awarded a grant of US$1.25 million from the\nhistorians Lisbet Rausing[82] and Peter Baldwin through Charities Aid\nFoundation, scheduled to be funded in five equal installments. The first\ninstallment of US$250,000 was received in April 2012 and the remaining were to\nbe funded in December 2012 through 2015. In 2014, the Foundation received the\nlargest single gift in its history, a $5 million unrestricted donation from an\nanonymous donor supporting $1 million worth of expenses annually for the next\nfive years.[84]\n\nIn 2015 a grant agreement was reached with the _John S. and James L.

The board has also at times created other\northodox entities[_clarification needed_] to support itself, such as executive\nsecretaries and ad-hoc committees established for specific tasks.\n\nThe current board comprises Patricio Lorente as Chairman and Alice Wiegand as\nVice-Chairman, together with Kelly Battles, Frieda Brioschi, Dariusz\nJemielniak, Guy Kawasaki, Mar\u00eda Sefidari, Denny Vrande\u010di\u0107, and Jimmy Wales as\nmembers at-large.[95]\n\nIn a high-profile decision of 2015, James Heilman was removed from the\nboard.[96][97] with little explanation.[96] In January 2016, Arnnon Geshuri\nstepped down from the board.[98]\n\n### Advisory board[edit]\n\nThe Advisory Board, according to the Wikimedia Foundation, is an international\nnetwork of experts who have agreed to give the foundation meaningful help on a\nregular basis in many different areas, including law, organizational\ndevelopment, technology, policy, and outreach.[99]\n\n## Staff[edit]\n\n### First appointments[edit]\n\n![File:Wikimedia Foundation Offices in San Francisco.webm](//upload.wikimedia.\norg/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Wikimedia_Foundation_Offices_in_San_Francisco\n.webm/220px--Wikimedia_Foundation_Offices_in_San_Francisco.webm.jpg)Play media\n\nStaff and workplace at Wikimedia Foundation's San Francisco office\n\nIn 2004, the foundation appointed Tim Starling as developer liaison to help\nimprove the MediaWiki software, Daniel Mayer as chief financial officer\n(finance, budgeting, and coordination of fund drives), and Erik M\u00f6ller as\ncontent partnership coordinator. In May 2005, the foundation announced seven\nmore official appointments.[100][_better\u00a0source\u00a0needed_]\n\nIn January 2006, the foundation created several committees, including the\nCommunication Committee, in an attempt to further organize activities\nessentially handled by volunteers at that time.[101] Starling resigned that\nmonth to spend more time on his PhD program.\n\n### Employees[edit]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Wikimedia_Foundation_O\nffice_Officey_Photos-5.jpg/220px-\nWikimedia_Foundation_Office_Officey_Photos-5.jpg)\n\nA workers area at the Wikimedia Foundation's San Francisco headquarters\n\nThe foundation's functions were, for the first few years, executed almost\nentirely by volunteers. In 2005, it had only two employees, Danny Wool, a\ncoordinator, and Brion Vibber, a software manager.\n\nAs of October 4, 2006[update], the foundation had five paid employees:[102]\ntwo programmers, an administrative assistant, a coordinator handling\nfundraising and grants, and an interim executive director,[103] Brad Patrick,\npreviously the foundation's general counsel. Patrick ceased his activity as\ninterim director in January 2007, and then resigned from his position as legal\ncounsel, effective April 1, 2007. He was replaced by Mike Godwin, who served\nas general counsel and legal coordinator from July 2007[104] until 2010.\n\nIn January 2007, Carolyn Doran was named chief operating officer and Sandy\nOrdonez joined as head of communications.[105] Doran began working as a part-\ntime bookkeeper in 2006 after being sent by a temporary agency. Doran later\nleft the foundation in July 2007, and Sue Gardner was hired as consultant and\nspecial advisor (later CEO). Her departure from the organization was cited by\nFlorence Devouard as one of the reasons the foundation took about seven months\nto release its fiscal 2007 financial audit.[106]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/149_New_Montgomery_Str\neet%2C_San_Francisco.jpg/220px-149_New_Montgomery_Street%2C_San_Francisco.jpg)\n\nThe location of the Wikimedia Foundation's San Francisco headquarters\n\nDanny Wool, officially the grant coordinator but also largely involved in\nfundraising and business development, resigned in March 2007. Wales was\naccused by former Wikimedia Foundation employee Danny Wool of misusing the\nfoundation's funds for recreational purposes. Wool also stated that Wales had\nhis Wikimedia credit card taken away in part because of his spending habits, a\nclaim Wales denied.[107] In February 2007, the foundation added a new\nposition, chapters coordinator, and hired Delphine M\u00e9nard,[108] who had been\noccupying the position as a volunteer since August 2005.

If you made edits from an IP address they will be displayed in a contributions page for that IP address. If you go to the page you edited, click on the view history tab at the top, find your edit which will show the IP address click \"contribs\" next to that entry and it will take you to the contributions made by that IP address. It is not possible to automatically link edits from an IP address to a logged-on contributor.\n\n    On a separate note, please don't start a new section relating to the same enquiry and please sign your posts on talk-pages using four tildes (~~~~) which will automatically produce a signature and time-stamp.

The correct spelling is CORESTA, a scientific international\norganisation related to tobacco. I could edit the name of the organisation,\nand addedthat ITC has been a founding member in 1956. I also tried to create a\nlink to the www.coresta.org website but could not make it in the text. Then I\ndid it in the external links but received a warning. I understand the reasons\nfor this warning, however I consider that since CORESTA has nothing to sell\n(it is a contributive not a trade organisation), and since it is named in the\ntext, a link to the website is acceptable. So I did not go further and ask\nforyour understanding. Searching CORESTA within Wikipedia brings a few\nresults, such as in ISO and various scientific papers used in references for\nwiki articles.\n\nOn the other hand, in the rolling tobacco article, CORESTA is named due to\nCORESTA unites. How could I describe how these units are measured?\n\nWith thanks and best regards\n\nPM Guitton Secretary General \u2014\u00a0Preceding unsigned comment added by CORESTA\n(talk \u2022 contribs) 11:56, 18 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n    \n\n    CORESTA, you are not allowed to use the name of an organisation as a user name. I'll block your account, but since you don't appear to have abused it by spamming, I'll allow you to create a new account. You should be very careful about editing any article where you have a conflict of interest. Post a request on the article talk page or see if anyone here is prepared to make the change. My own view is that linking to your company is likely to be seen as a spam link **Jimfbleak** \\- talk to me? 13:05, 18 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n## My contribution[edit]\n\nComment removed from here and transferred to \"enquiry\" above. Eagleash (talk)\n13:06, 18 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n## SPI case not appearing on case list[edit]\n\nLast night, I opened a sockpuppet investigations case here. However, the case\nstill isn't showing up on the list of cases, even though a bot is supposed to\nadd it, and some other cases which were opened after mine have appeared there.\nDoes anyone know why it won't show up? --A guy saved by Jesus (talk) 16:10, 18\nMarch 2016 (UTC)\n\n    The bot thinks the page is malformed, but I can't see what is wrong with it. -- John of Reading (talk) 16:47, 18 March 2016 (UTC) \n\n    Hmm...that's odd. I can't see what's wrong with it either, and I don't see how anything could be wrong with it in the first place, since I created the report using Twinkle. --A guy saved by Jesus (talk) 17:42, 18 March 2016 (UTC) \n\n    Apparently the bot liked it after I tweaked the white space at the top of the case page. The bot operator, Fastily (ping!), might be able to confirm this. -- John of Reading (talk) 07:16, 19 March 2016 (UTC) \n\n    It's due to a caching issue with the WMF servers, which are providing the bot with bad information to work with. Fortunately, as you've described above, this is easily resolved by making a null edit to the page in question\u00a0:) -FASTILY 21:25, 19 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n## Non-linked images[edit]\n\nI thought all images in Wikipedia articles linked to their source upload page\nwhere you could read about their licence and history.\n\nHowever the top image in Kerch Strait Bridge doesn't link. Why? How do I\ndiscover its provenance? -- SGBailey (talk) 20:59, 18 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n    Interesting! I've not seen that before. Here is a link to the image though. Dismas|(talk) 21:08, 18 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n    Take a look at the code for the template (Superimpose2) you'll notice that in the example when you click on the image, it links to a page instead of the image location. So my guess is that it has to do with the coding of superimpose2 because the regular Superimpose doesn't do that, it goes to the image location instead. _Book-Portal_ &amp; Talk _16:28, 18 March 2016 (UTC)_\n\n    Hi @SGBailey, I fixed this for the Kerch Strait Bridge page by adding the parameter `|base_link=File:` to each of the {{superimpose2}} transclusions. As BookPortal says, adding base_link explicitly shouldn't be necessary, because `File:` was the default base_link value in the original {{superimpose}}, with which {{superimpose2}} aims to be compatible. I suppose this is an edge case that you are the first person to notice. I'm not a template (or anything else) expert myself, but as the main developer of superimpose2 (@Sameboat) is still active on enwiki perhaps he could help? - Pointillist (talk) 21:47, 18 March 2016 (UTC) \n\n    This can be easily fixed by changing `{{{base_link|}}}` in the template to `{{#if:{{{base_link|}}}|{{{base_link}}}|File:}}`. But this template is being heavily used by Wikipedia:Route diagram template, I am not sure the consequence of this change to the rest of the diagram templates. -- Sameboat - \u540c\u821f (talk \u00b7 contri.) 03:58, 19 March 2016 (UTC) \n\n    Thanks for replying, @Sameboat:. I will copy this entire section to Template talk:Superimpose2 so that others can decide whether to make that change. - Pointillist (talk) 13:27, 19 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n## How exactly do I alter or manipulate a \"sorting\" result?[edit]\n\nThe article is this one: Ansonia, Connecticut#Mayors of Ansonia. In that\nchart, the fifth column is entitled \"Term Length\". When I sort it, I want the\nnumbers to sort correctly. Which it does now. However, there are a few\ninstances in which the mayor served for less than one year. Right now, I have\nit labeled as **\"0 years\"**. (Which sorts just fine.) However, I really don't\nwant the chart to read **\"0 years\"** for those mayors. I want it to say\n**\"&lt; 1 year\"** (i.e., less than a year). But, when I use that as the entry,\nthe sorting gets all screwed up. And the **\"less than one year\"** ( or **&lt;\n1 year** ) mayors get sorted in an odd fashion. Which defeats the purpose of\nthe sort. What would be the exact command I would use to fix this? I am not\nall that great with HTML code (or whatever this is called). So, please use\nbasic instructions. Thanks. Joseph A. Spadaro (talk) 21:26, 18 March 2016\n(UTC)\n\n    I went into the chart just now. And I made one mayor listed as **\"0 years\"**. And I made another mayor listed as **\"&lt; 1 year\"**. With both of these in there, you can notice the correct (and incorrect) results of the sorting. Obviously, I want the **\"&lt; 1 year\"** to sort as being _smaller/less than_ a mayor who is listed as **\"1 year\"** or **\"2 years\"**, etc. As it now stands, the **\"&lt; 1 year\"** mayor gets sorted as if he has _more time_ than the **\"14 years\"** mayor. Thanks. Joseph A. Spadaro (talk) 21:30, 18 March 2016 (UTC) \n\n    You can use data-sort-value for this. |data-sort-value=\"0\"|&lt; 1 year would sort it based on \"0\", not \"&lt; 1 year\". The first value is what gets sorted, and the second value is what gets displayed. NinjaRobotPirate (talk) 22:32, 18 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    Thanks. Yes, that worked perfectly. Thanks.

In some wikis you can get welcome messages or something else posted to your talk page even if you have no edits.

Spadaro (talk) 17:01, 19 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n    \n\n    That's true, Joseph A. Spadaro, but what you have on your German talk page de:Benutzer Diskussion:Joseph A. Spadaro is a notice from 2014 that the German article de:2009 Taconic State Parkway crash, which you had made substantial contributions to, had been nominated for deletion (and since it's a redlink, I presume that it was deleted). Since you have made substantion contributions to the en article by that name, I presume that somebody had translated it and somehow copied the history over. --ColinFine (talk) 22:59, 19 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    @ColinFine: Thanks.

Spadaro (talk) 02:17, 20 March 2016 (UTC) \n\n    @Joseph A. Spadaro: Other language Wikipedias have a import via translation option that can be used to machine translate enwiki articles into their native language and import all the text. This method also imports the edit history for attribution purposes. In the past you probably edited 2009 Taconic State Parkway crash which at one point was imported over to dewiki. Since the edit history was also imported you, technically, edited that article as well. New edits to the enwiki version made after the import would not be transferred over as the translation is only a one time thing. --Majora (talk) 02:49, 20 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    Thanks.

The bot removes the tag based off of the first timestamp immediately after the banner (while still in the same section). Since the banner was at the bottom the bot got confused and removed it. Place it at the top and you should be good to go. Generally, you should start a new section when starting a RfC. That way the banner, and the bot, function correctly. Also, new sections should go on the _bottom_ of the talk page. --Majora (talk) 01:28, 19 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n    \n\n    @Majora: Thanks.

Thanks!\nTenbergen (talk) 02:33, 19 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n    @Tenbergen: The relevant guideline is WP:COI. There's no specific rule against editing an article with which you have a conflict of interest, but editors are discouraged from doing so. This is because it's difficult to realize when you've unintentionally inserted POV prose. Minor edits, such as fixing errors and reverting vandalism, are uncontroversial. It's a bit bureaucratic, but the suggested method is to propose changes on the talk page and gain consensus for them. You can use {{request edit}} to formally request that an uninvolved editor make an edit for you. One important rule is that the WMF's Terms of Use require editors to disclose any paid editing. You should read that part of the ToU carefully if you have received any compensation for editing Wikipedia.

Right now,\nits size is being squished down to fit to the left of the infobox.

I have a question about consensus regarding the notability of schools.\nI recently nominated a school article for deletion at Wikipedia:Articles for\ndeletion/Good Shepherd English School, because I felt that the school did not\nmeet our notability requirements, but also as a bit of a test case. The AfD\nhas been closed as snow keep, after some editors pointed to WP:SCHOOLOUTCOMES.\nNow, that page is not presenting a policy or guideline, but rather summarising\ntypical results of AfD discussions. Isn't closing an AfD as keep because an\nessay says that such AfDs are typically closed as keep a case of circular\nreasoning, though? How would one challenge this consensus? If I try to\nchallenge WP:SCHOOLOUTCOMES, then editors there can point to all of the recent\nAfD keeps, but articles are being kept because of WP:SCHOOLOUTCOMES. If the\nlatter was a notability guideline, then I would discuss proposed changes on\nits talk page, but this essay is not inaccurate - most secondary school AfDs\ndo indeed close as keep, but through circular reasoning. Any suggestions where\nI should take this? Cordless Larry (talk) 08:53, 19 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n    I would suggest raising this at Village pump (policy) as it is a centralised policy discussion page where you'll have a higher chance of getting more attention and opinions.

I asked: \"How are all of these local high schools all over the place _notable_?\" I was basically told that educational institutions fall under a lot of governmental oversight. As such, they are always included in many official reports and such. This provides reliable sources. Thus, they become \"notable\" through reliable sources.

The cell content comes after a pipe. You can combine left alignment with padding:\n    `| align=\"left\" style=\"padding: 2em;\" | John F. Kennedy`\n    Padding will often be a disadvantage on narrow screens so there is rarely good reason to use large padding like 2em. When it's used with left alignment it can also mean the text ends up to the right of the center. That looks bad. PrimeHunter (talk) 22:09, 19 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n    \n\n    @PrimeHunter: Perfect!

Sometimes Mediawiki, the software that Wikipedia uses, will allow you to undo it, but usually it's impossible for older edits, as people will have edited that section since the vandalism was inserted. In those cases, the best thing to do is check the diff to see what changed, then manually fix it yourself. For example, in the diff that you posted above, you can see that some text was moved around the article, and \"Trol\" was added to a header. The \"trol\" thing is almost certainly vandalism, and that \"nowiki\" thing is also vandalism. I don't know if the text should have been moved, because I don't know anything about the subject. It looks like it shouldn't have been. It looks like it probably messed up the timeline by moving the text around like that. NinjaRobotPirate (talk) 23:41, 19 March 2016 (UTC) \n\n    I think I fixed the article. What I did was compare the version before the vandalism and the one that exists now. In the earlier version of the article, it flowed from 1661 to 1662 to 1663 to de Pe\u00f1alosa's death in 1687. The vandalized version moved a few paragraphs around, so that it didn't make much sense any more, and the 1662 history was transposed to the 1687 part of his history. I moved the paragraphs back to proper placement. I'm pretty sure, at least. NinjaRobotPirate (talk) 23:52, 19 March 2016 (UTC)\n    Where the subsequent edits are short and simple, it can be easier to undo to the point before the vandalism, then re-do the subsequent edits before saving, but, if you use this method, be sure to check that you have retained the genuine edits. Opening a separate window where you can compare differences as you edit helps to keep track. _Dbfirs_ 09:42, 21 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n## Why is there no articles for creation tag/rating on my article?[edit]\n\nI created both of these articles through the articles for creation wizard:\nChain-ladder method Bornhuetter-Ferguson method\n\nThe first one has an articles for creation tag on the talk page and was rated\non the quality scale, but the latter wasn't.

I am a radio professional and I try to properly edit and\nadd information to the Wikipedia pages for different radio stations. Within a\ncouple of hours this person reverts everything I wrote back to his original\narticle. It's amazing. It's almost like he's watching everything I do and\nwithin hours he erases everything!\n\nOn Saturday I tried to improve the article on WHJJ, a Providence, Rhode Island\nradio station. I included new info on the station, added to the info box and\nupdated some facts. I checked back this morning (Sunday) and everything I did\nwas undone. Not a word was left. I checked the History page for WHJJ and this\nperson did the same thing to someone else who tried to edit the WHJJ page in\nFebruary. That person also had all his edits removed by this same culprit.\n\nIn the past, when this person has removed all my edits to a page about a\nRoanoke, Virginia radio station, I returned my writing. He again reverted the\npage back to where it was before, and reported me as being involved in an edit\nwar. I suppose that's what this person does to others who try to change his\nfavorite pages.\n\nThis is very discouraging and makes me not want to help improve Wikipedia.\nEven if you say, maybe I was incorrect in some of my edits, surely I'm not\nwrong in EVERYTHING I've written. What can I do?\n\n### More on Removing Edits from my previous post above[edit]\n\nI just checked another radio station, WOAI (AM) in San Antonio. According to\nthe \"History Page\" I see this same person, on March 15th, removed all the\nedits someone else made to the WOAI (AM) page. One person made revisions in\nthe morning and the culprit removed all the revisions by the afternoon. So I\nguess he's not just doing it to me, but to anyone who attempts to edit his\nfavorite pages.\n\nWhat can we do about someone who keeps removing others work in its entirety?\n\n    Hi, Steve1reg. First, when you post on a talk or discussion page like this one, please sign your contribution with four tildes (~~~~) so that we can see who is posting, and find your contributions easily. Also, please don't start a new section to add to a topic here: just continue the existing section.\n\n    I agree that Stereorock seems to have been following you around undoing your edits. That doesn't mean that either of you is right or wrong. What it means is that you need to be engaging with each other on a talk page: either the user talk page of one of you, or the talk page of one of the articles. So far, as far as I can see, neither of you has done this. I observe that Stereorock's edit on WKOX (AM) has the comment \"WP:NOTRADIOGUIDE\". This means that, in Stereorock's opinion, your edits there are inappropriate because they break the policy in WP:NOTRADIOGUIDE \\- it might not be obvious to you what that comment meant, but you should have asked Stereorock on a talk page rather than bringing the question here. On WHJJ, your edits were more substantial, and Stereorock's did not make a comment explaining their reversion: there I think Stereorock should have engaged with you rather than just reverting.\n    So the upshot is: you two need to have a discussion and try to reach agreement (and if you can't, follow the procedure for dispute resolution). One last point: Wikipedia is not very impressed by people describing themselves as professional. While we welcome people with expert knowledge to help improve articles, that does not necessarily privilege their contributions over other editors: what matters is whether the material is well expressed, and (most importantly) cited to reliable sources. --ColinFine (talk) 12:06, 20 March 2016 (UTC) \n\n    \n\n    Unfortunately, the content dispute procedures in dispute resolution are intended for dispute about one (or at most a few) articles, and this pattern has to do with many articles. Try discussing on talk pages anyway. Robert McClenon (talk) 16:30, 20 March 2016 (UTC)\n    The original poster forgets to sign their posts, and appears to have robotic signing turned off. That makes it difficult to see the history of what the original poster is complaining about. Remember to sign your posts, and turn robotic signing back on. As the other editors have said, discuss on the article talk pages. However, this applies to many pages, and that indicates a more general problem. The problem may be that Stereorock is stalking the edits of Steve1reg for no good reason, or it may be that Stereorock thinks that Steve1reg is violating policy. Try to discuss on at least one talk page. Is there a WP:WikiProject Radio? If so, try discussing there also.

It has resulted in several\nartists, as in painters, sculptors, etc. being recategorized as \"entertainers\"\n- even articles about seriously famous artists such as Frida Kahlo and Henri\nde Toulouse-Lautrec have been affected. They should be in Category:Artists\nwith disabilities, not Category:Entertainers with disabilities. I have an idea\nthat cleaning up this mess might need an admin mop.

Try posting your suggestion on the talk page for rose and be sure to put {{edit semi-protected}} at the top of your message because you can't edit the article due to its semi-protection; the template will call over another editor to add the info on your behalf. Also, don't forget to **say why** you want these references added and how they'll be useful for the article.

They don't have\naccount creator permissions. Example image \u2014Skyllfully (talk | contribs)\n16:40, 20 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n    @Skyllfully: Anyone can create a new account by going to Special:CreateAccount while signed in (the form will change to include a reason box). The account creator only adds a a few extra rights. ACs have three additional rights that normal people do not have. The ability to override the anti-spoof feature that blocks similar usernames, the ability to override the username blacklist, and the ability to override the username creation limit. This last one is the one they use most often and is why AC is given for edit-a-thons. The MediaWiki software has a strict limit of 6 accounts create per IP in a 24 hour period (see WP:ACCP). The right will allow edit-a-thons coordinators to override this limit. --Majora (talk) 17:12, 20 March 2016 (UTC) \n\n    Thank you!

I found my way to the\nrelevant part of the ten-volume work by Arctic explorer Knud Rasmussen, who\ncollected her tale. The text I was reading was raw, with plenty of machine\ntranscription errors, but it served my purpose. Now I can't find it anywhere\nonline: Google Books acknowledges its existence, but I can't see more than\noccasional snippets. I seem to recall that there is a resource somewhere in\nWikipedia that might help me.

The specific\nexample I have in mind is the altitude of Mont Blanc. It is a well-known\nmountain whose snow-capped summit was once regarded as having a constant\nheight of c. 4,807 metres, but detailed GPS measurements every two years is\nnow producing a regular change in the 'official' figures. Different pages\nacross Wikipedia state different heights, which can't help to bolster\nWikipedia's credibility. e.g. 4,810 m: Extreme points of the European Union;\n4,808 m\u00a0: Geography of France; 4,807 m: Retreat of glaciers since 1850;\n\nI envisage that the discussion about what any 'official' figure is needs only\nto be held in one single place, then consensus agreed upon. If some sort of\ntemplate code had then been inserted into every article or Infobox referring\nback to that agreed figure, then a change in one central discussion page would\ncascade to every article using that template.\n\nI'm sure this issue must have arisen in numerous other contexts, and it would\nbe an elegant solution to a not particularly serious but nevertheless irksome\nproblem. I look forward to hearing that a simple solution to an annoying\nvariance in factual statements across Wikipedia does indeed exist.

Dr. Mayer has taken credit for it but he was no\nwhere near the hospital when this all unfolded. He DID NOT \"notice the opaque\nareas on the xray and CT Scan.\" as stated below.
